<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Eagles Over The Alps: Suvorov In Italy and Switzerland, 1799</h2><p>1799--Russia's greatest soldier was at war in Italy and Switzerland. Led by Suvorov, believed by many to be the equal of Napoleon, the Russian and Austrian troops claimed one victory after another against the French. Much more than strategy and tactics, this a&nbsp;story of adventure as a Russian army fights desperate rearguard actions, and tries to escape through cruel mountain passes in the night. Suvorov's memory is still treasured in the Russian armed forces today. The last and greatest campaign of this legendary soldier has found a fitting narrator in Christopher Duffy. Suvorov's marches and battles can be traced on the many maps, photographs, and original artwork recreates the appearance of the troops.</p><p></p><h2>A Season of Joy (Work and the Glory)</h2><p>The popular, award-winning series The Work and the Glory continues with A Season of Joy, which literally spans the globe as it follows the story of the restored Church and the fictional Steed family through two eventful years (1839-1841). It is a season of rejuvenationas, after the horrors of the Missouri persecutions, the Saints find refuge across the Mississippi in Illinois, where they found the city of Nauvoo. Their community grows rapidly, miracles occur (including Joseph&#39;s raising of many from their sickbeds), the work of the Restoration rolls forward and the Steeds are there for it all. Matthew and Derek accompany members of the Twelve on the Quorum&#39;s mission to England, and there they witness a dramatic harvest of souls, including Wilford Woodruff&#39;s remarkable success. Meanwhile, the fate of Will Steed is made known, and characters from previous volumes reenter the story. In addition, since this period in Church history is not without its tensions, its trials, and its tragedies, members of the Steed family experience all of these as well. Through some of the most realistic and tender scenes of the series, readers will come to know these beloved characters even more intimately than ever before. As with the previous volumes, personalities from Church history come to vivid life here, particularly those of the incomparable Joseph Smith and the faithful, steadfast Brigham Young. Here, then, is another exciting, engaging installment in this acclaimed series, a story that reveals God&#39;s infinite mercy and wisdom in granting his people a season of relief, a season of hope, a season of joy.</p><p>Gerald Lund received his B.A. and M.S. degrees in sociology from Brigham Young University, and has done post-graduate work in the New Testament and Hebrew at Pepperdine University and the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, California. <p>Employed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints' Church Educational System (CES) for many years, he has been a seminary teacher, an institute teacher and director, a curriculum writer, a director of college curriculum, and a zone administrator. </p><p>Elder Lund is a member of the Second Quorum of the Seventy and is currently serving in the Area Presidency of the Europe West Area. </p><p>Gerald Lund is among the most-read authors in Church literature.

What started as an exercise in oils was soon taken up in various media --pin-up mascots graced the fuselages of American fighters, and became an essential feature of the male world of garages and barracks. The age of political correctness hasn&#39;t ended their appeal. This book tells the tale of a genre as utterly American as the paintings of Edward Hopper, describing its origins and development in detail and showcasing the most important artists. With over 900 illustrations (many full-page), The Great America Pin-Up is one of the first comprehensive studies of the genre to appear anywhere. We get work by Gillette A. (Gil) Elvgren, Edward Runci, Edward D&#39;Ancona, Art Frahm, Zoe Mozert, Earl Mac Pherson, Joyce Ballantyne and many, many others --some you may know of and others you will be pleased to get to know.</p><p></p><h2>Scandinavian Design</h2><p><p>Scandinavia is world famous for its inimitable, democratic designs which bridge the gap between crafts and industrial production, organic forms and everyday functionality.

In <i>The Code Book</i>, Simon Singh, author of the bestselling <i>Fermat's Enigma</i>, offers a peek into the world of cryptography and codes, from ancient texts through computer encryption. Singh's compelling history is woven through with stories of how codes and ciphers have played a vital role in warfare, politics, and royal intrigue. The major theme of <i>The Code Book</i> is what Singh calls "the ongoing evolutionary battle between codemakers and codebreakers," never more clear than in the chapters devoted to World War II. Cryptography came of age during that conflict, as secret communications became critical to either side's success. <p> </p><blockquote>Confronted with the prospect of defeat, the Allied cryptanalysts had worked night and day to penetrate German ciphers. It would appear that fear was the main driving force, and that adversity is one of the foundations of successful codebreaking.</blockquote><p> In the information age, the fear that drives cryptographic improvements is both capitalistic and libertarian--corporations need encryption to ensure that their secrets don't fall into the hands of competitors and regulators, and ordinary people need encryption to keep their everyday communications private in a free society. Similarly, the battles for greater <i>decryption</i> power come from said competitors and governments wary of insurrection. <i>The Code Book</i> is an excellent primer for those wishing to understand how the human need for privacy has manifested itself through cryptography. Singh's accessible style and clear explanations of complex algorithms cut through the arcane mathematical details without oversimplifying. Can't get enough crypto? Try solving the Cipher Challenge in the back of the book--$15,000 goes to the first person to crack the code! <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Codes have decided the fates of empires, countries, and monarchies throughout recorded history. Mary, Queen of Scots was put to death by her cousin, Queen Elizabeth, for the high crime of treason after spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham cracked the secret code she used to communicate with her conspirators. And thus the course of British history was altered by a few sheets of cryptic prose. This is just one link in humankind's evolutionary chain of secret communication, and just one of the fascinating incidents recounted in <b>The Code Book</b>, written by bestselling author Simon Singh.<br><br>Combining a superb storyteller's sense of drama and a scientist's appreciation for technical perfection, Singh traces the evolution of secret writing from ancient Greek military espionage to the frontiers of computer science. The result is an epic tale of human ingenuity, with examples that range from the poignant to the peculiar to the world-historical.<br><br>There is the case of the Beale ciphers, which involves Wild West escapades, a cowboy who amassed a vast fortune, a buried treasure worth $20 million, and a mysterious set of encrypted papers describing its whereabouts--papers that have baffled generations of cryptanalysts and captivated hundreds of treasure hunters.<br><br>A speedier end to a bloody war was the only reward that could be promised to the Allied code breakers of World Wars I and II, whose selfless contributions altered the course of history; but few of them lived to receive any credit for their top-secret accomplishments. Among the most moving of these stories is that of the World War II British code breaker Alan Turing, who gave up a brilliant career in mathematics to devote himself to the Allied cause, only to end his years punished by the state for his homosexuality, while his heroism was ignored. No less heroic were the Navajo code talkers, who volunteered without hesitation to risk their lives for the Allied forces in the Japanese theater, where they were routinely mistaken for the enemy.<br><br>Interspersed with these gripping stories are clear mathematical, linguistic, and technological demonstrations of codes, as well as illustrations of the remarkable personalities--many courageous, some villainous, and all obsessive--who wrote and broke them.<br><br>All roads lead to the present day, in which the possibility of a truly unbreakable code looms large. Singh explores this possibility, and the ramifications of our increasing need for privacy, even as it begins to chafe against the stated mission of the powerful and deeply secretive National Security Agency. Entertaining, compelling, and remarkably far-reaching, this is a book that will forever alter your view of history, what drives it, and how private that e-mail you just sent really is.<br><br>Included in the book is a worldwide Cipher Challenge--a $15,000 award will be given by the author to the first reader who cracks the code successfully. Progress toward the solution will be tracked on The Code Book website.</p><h2>Forget Me Not</h2><p><p>The terrible tragedy Alana Reeves suffered on Wyoming's Broken Mountain has vanished from her memory.

But a man has appeared from the shadows of Alana's past -- a rugged outdoorsman who once dwelt in a wounded heart he is now sworn to heal. Like an answered prayer, Rate Winter has come to lead Alana out of the darkness -- and back to the scene of the nightmare she has erased from her mind. Alana must follow him -- for in Rate's powerful arms her fears can be conquered, and through his love hers can be reborn.</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell has more than eighty titles published to date with over twenty-four million copies of her books in print.

In 2008, he won the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.</p>1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Jack might have reacted differently if he&#x2019;d seen the punch coming. He might have been able to hold back a little. But he was caught off guard, and what followed shocked everyone. Jack most of all. <br>No surprise where it came from. Rico had been riding him since the summer, and pushing especially hard today. <br>The morning had started as usual. Giovanni Pastorelli, boss and owner of Two Paisanos Landscaping, had picked him up at a predesignated subway stop in Brooklyn&#x2014;Jack lived in Manhattan and trained out&#x2014;and then picked up the four Dominicans who made up the rest of the crew. The Dominicans all lived together in a crowded apartment in Bushwick but Giovanni refused to drive through there. He made the &#x201c;wetbacks&#x201d;&#x2014;his not-unaffectionate term for them when they weren&#x2019;t around&#x2014;train to a safer neighborhood. <br>Jack had arrived in the city in June and came across the Two Paisanos boss in July at a nursery. His landscaping business had started with two paisanos but now had only one, Giovanni, who almost laughed Jack off when he&#x2019;d asked if he needed an extra hand. He was a twenty-one-year-old who looked younger. But he&#x2019;d worked with a number of landscapers in high school and college, and ten minutes of talk convinced the boss he&#x2019;d be taking on experienced help. <br>But Jack&#x2019;s knowledge of Spanish, rudimentary though it was, clinched the hire. The boss had come over from Sicily with his folks at age eight and had lived in Bath Beach forever. He spoke Italian and English but little Spanish. Jack had taken Spanish in high school and some at Rutgers. The Dominicans who made up the rest of Giovanni&#x2019;s crew spoke next to no English. <br>Giovanni worked them all like dogs seven days a week but no harder than he worked himself. He liked to say, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get plenty of days off&#x2014;in the winter.&#x201d; He paid cash, four bucks an hour&#x2014;twenty cents above minimum wage&#x2014;with no overtime but also no deductions. <br>Though a newcomer, Jack quickly became Giovanni&#x2019;s go-to guy. He could understand the Dominicans if they spoke slowly, and was able to relay the boss&#x2019;s work orders to them. <br>Before Jack, that had been Rico&#x2019;s job. He spoke little English, but enough to act as go-between. He probably felt demoted. Plus, Giovanni loved to talk and would launch long, rambling monologues about wine, women, and Italy at Jack, something never possible with Rico. That had to gall him. He&#x2019;d been with Giovanni&#x2014;or <i>jefe,</i> as he called him&#x2014;for years, then Jack strolls in and becomes right-hand man within weeks of his arrival. <br>Jack had come to like Giovanni. He was something of a peacock with his pompadour hair and waxed mustache, and could be a harsh taskmaster when they were running late or weather put him behind schedule. But he was unfailingly fair, paying on time and to the dime. <br>He liked his &#x201c;wetbacks&#x201d; and respected how hard they worked. But his old-country values didn&#x2019;t allow much respect for his clients. <br>&#x201c;A man who won&#x2019;t work his own land don&#x2019;t deserve it.&#x201d; <br>Jack had lost count of how many times he&#x2019;d heard him mutter that as they&#x2019;d unload the mowers and blowers and weed whackers from the trailer. Giovanni charged jaw-dropping lawn maintenance fees, but people paid him. He had the quality homeowners wanted most in their gardener: He showed up. On top of that, he and his crew did good work. <br>On this otherwise unremarkable late October day, the Two Paisanos crew was in Forest Hills performing a fall cleanup around a two-story Tudor in the shadow of the West Side Tennis Club stadium. Last month they&#x2019;d worked at the club itself, planting mums for the fall. His dad was a big tennis fan and Jack remembered seeing the place on TV when the US Open was held here. <br>Carlos, Juan, and Ramon were happy-go-lucky sorts who loved having a job and money to spend in the midst of a recession. But Rico had a chip on his shoulder. Today he&#x2019;d started in the moment he got in the truck. Childish stuff. He was seated behind Jack so he began jabbing his knees against Jack&#x2019;s seat back. Jack seethed. The months of bad &#x2019;tude and verbal abuse were getting to him. But he did his best to ignore the guy. Rico never seemed to be playing with a full deck anyway, and appeared to be missing more cards than usual today. <br>When they reached the work site Rico started with the name-calling in Spanish. One thing lacking in his Spanish classes in Rutgers had been vernacular obscenities. But Jack had picked up quite a few since July. Rico was using them all. Usually the comments were directed at Jack, but today Rico had expanded into Jack&#x2019;s ancestry, particularly his parents. With Jack&#x2019;s mother buried less than a year now, the guy was stomping on hallowed ground. But he didn&#x2019;t know that. Jack set his jaw, tamped the fire rising within, and put on his headphones. He started UB40&#x2019;s latest spinning in his Discman. The easy, mid-tempo reggae of <i>Labour of Love</i> <i>II</i> offered a peaceful break from Rico&#x2019;s rants. <br>Rico must have become royally pissed that he couldn&#x2019;t get a rise. So pissed he hauled off and sucker-punched Jack in the face. <br>As his headphones went flying and pain exploded in his cheek, Jack felt something snap. Not physically, but mentally, emotionally. A darkness enveloped him. He&#x2019;d felt it surge up in him before, but never like this. He took martial arts classes but whatever he&#x2019;d learned was lost in an explosive rush of uncontrollable rage. Usually he fought it, but this time he embraced it. A dark joy filled him as he leaped at Rico with an animal howl. <br>He pounded his face, feeling his nose snap beneath his knuckles, his lips shred against his teeth. Rico reeled back, and Jack quarter-spun his body as he aimed a kick at his left knee. His boot heel connected with the outside of the knee, caving it inward. Even over the roaring in his ears he could hear the ligaments snap. As Rico went down, Jack stomped on the knee, then kicked him in the ribs, once, twice. As Rico clutched his chest and rolled onto his side, Jack picked up a bowling-ball-size rock from the garden border and raised it to smash his head. <br>A pair of powerful arms encircled him and wrenched him around. He lost his grip on the rock and it landed on the grass, denting the turf. Giovanni&#x2019;s voice was shouting close behind his left ear. <br>&#x201c;Enough! He&#x2019;s down! He&#x2019;s finished! Stop it, for fuck&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; <br>The darkness receded, Jack&#x2019;s vision cleared, and he saw Rico on the ground, his face bloodied, wailing as one arm clutched his ribs and another his knee. <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Jack said, relaxing as he stared in wonder at Rico. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d; <br>What just happened? <br>Maybe five seconds had passed. So little time, so much damage. <br>Carlos, Juan, and Ramon stood in a semicircle behind Rico, their gazes shifting from Jack to their fallen roommate, their expressions alternating between fear and anger. <br>Giovanni released him from behind and spun him around. He looked frightened, upset. <br>&#x201c;What were you gonna do? Kill him?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I mean, no. I guess I lost it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Lost it! Damn right, you lost it!&#x201d; He looked over Jack&#x2019;s shoulder at where Rico lay. &#x201c;Christ, I never seen anything like it.&#x201d; His expression darkened. &#x201c;You better get outta here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can catch an E or an F back into the city over on Seventy-first Avenue.&#x201d; <br>Jack felt a new surge of anger, but nothing like before. &#x201c;Hey, aren&#x2019;t we forgetting something here? I was the guy who was minding his own business when he&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I know all about it, but you&#x2019;re still upright and moving. He ain&#x2019;t walking anywhere after the way you fucked up his knee.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So nothing. I know these guys. They&#x2019;re thick like brothers. You stick around you&#x2019;re gonna find some hedge trimmers chewing up your face. Or a shovel flattening the back of your head. Git. They&#x2019;ll cool down if you&#x2019;re not around.&#x201d; <br>The heat surged again. He was ready to take on the remaining three right now. <br>&#x201c; <i>They&#x2019;ll</i> cool down? What about me?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a jerk. You&#x2019;re outnumbered. Move. I&#x2019;ll call you later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; Jack said, resisting the urge to take a swing at Giovanni. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother.&#x201d; <br>Railing silently at the unfairness of it all, he picked up his Discman and started walking. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2012 by F.

The prophetic mysteries are revealed through an intriguing and engaging narrative the reader will find hard to put down. The Harbinger opens with the appearance of a man burdened with a message he has received from a mysterious figure called The Prophet. The Prophet has given him nine seals, each containing a message about America s future. As he tells of his encounters with The Prophet, from a skyscraper in New York City, to a rural mountaintop, to Capitol Hill, to Ground Zero, the mystery behind each seal is revealed. As the story unfolds, each revelation becomes a piece in a greater puzzle the ramifications of which will even alter the course of world history.</p><p></p><h2>Ocean</h2><p>Lying beneath Europa's (Jupiter's moon) half-mile-thick mantle of shear ice is the only ocean in the solar system besides those on Earth.

Almost immediately, a number of foreign customers pressed Moscow for deliveries of this long-overdue type, expected to succeed the popular MiG-21 as a standard interceptor. Correspondingly, large numbers of MiG-23 interceptors and fighter-bombers were exported to five major Arab air forces in the mid-1970s.<br><br>This is a detailed history of the operational service of this Soviet-manufactured interceptor and its fighter-bomber variants in service with Algerian, Egyptian, Iraqi, Libyan, and Syrian air forces, since 1974. While Egypt purchased only a handful before its final break with Moscow, and Algeria limited related acquisitions, Iraq, Libya and Syria continued purchasing advanced variants in significant numbers through the 1980s. The units operating MiG-23s were soon transformed into the backbone of the military services in question, and they saw combat service in a number of intensive military conflicts. In the 1980s, they fought against Israeli jets over Lebanon, against the Iranians in the Iran-Iraq War, and confronted US Navy&#x2019;s F-14s on numerous occasions off Libya.

Somewhere he had read that public speaking was one of the most commonplace fears, but that wasn't a lot of help right then. He glanced at his notes for the hundredth time, told himself that there was nothing to be nervous about, and straightened his tie again.<br><br>The room itself-the exhibit hall of the Newberry Library-had been nicely appointed for the event. Lighted display cases held a selection of the rare manuscripts from the library's collection, and a classical ensemble, playing antique instruments, had only just stop-ped playing. A computerized lectern was set up on a dais at the front of the hall.<br><br>"It's showtime," Dr. Armbruster, the matronly chief administrator, whispered in his ear; she was dressed in her usual gray skirt and jacket, but she had enlivened it for the occasion with a rhinestone brooch in the shape of an open book. Stepping out to the lectern, she welcomed everyone to the event. "And thanks, especially," she added, "for coming out on such a freezing day."<br><br>There was an appreciative murmur, followed by a bit of coughing and rustling as the thirty or forty people present settled into their chairs. Most of them were middle-aged or older-well-heeled and successful book lovers and friends of the library. The men were generally white-haired, and wore bow ties, Harris tweeds, and flannel pants; their wives were in pearls and carried Ferragamo handbags. This was Old Chicago money, from the Gold Coast and the suburbs of the North Shore, along with a smattering of academic types from Northwestern or Loyola. The profs were the ones in the rumpled corduroy trousers and jackets. Later, they'd be the first to hit the buffet line. David had learned never to stand between a professor and a free Swedish meatball.<br><br>"And on behalf of the Newberry," Dr. Armbruster was saying, "one of Chicago's landmarks since 1883, I want to thank you all for your continued support. Without your generosity, I don't know what we'd do. As you know, we are a private institution, and we rely upon our friends and associates to sustain the library in every way, from the acquisition of new materials to, well, just paying the electric bill."<br><br>An elderly wag in the front row waved a checkbook in the air, and there was some polite laughter.<br><br>"You can put that away for now," Dr. Armbruster said, then added with a laugh, "But keep it handy."<br><br>David shifted from one foot to the other, nervously awaiting his cue.<br><br>"I think most of you know David Franco, who's not only our youngest but one of our most industrious staff members. A summa cum laude graduate of Amherst College, David was the winner of a Fulbright Scholarship to Italy, where he studied Renaissance art and literature at the Villa I Tatti. Recently, he completed his doctorate at our own University of Chicago, and all this," she said, turning toward David, "before the age of what? Thirty?"<br><br>Blushing fiercely, David said, "Not quite. I turned thirty-one last Friday."<br><br>"Oh, well, in that case," Dr. Armbruster said, turning back toward the audience, "you'd better get a move on."<br><br>There was a welcome wave of laughter.<br><br>"But as you can see," she continued, "when we received, as an anonymous gift, the 1534 copy of Dante's Divine Comedy, printed in Florence, we knew there was only one person to hand it over to. David has supervised its physical restoration-you would never guess what its binding looked like when we first acquired it-but has also entered its entire text, and its many illustrations, into our digital archive. That way, it can become available to scholars and researchers the world over. Today, he's going to show us some of the most beautiful and intriguing images from the book, and also, I think," she said, glancing encouragingly at David, "take us on a brief tour of the poem's nature imagery?"<br><br>David nodded, his stomach doing a quick backflip, as Dr. Armbruster stepped away from the microphone. "David, it's all yours."<br><br>There was a round of subdued applause as he tilted the microphone higher, spread his papers on the lectern, took a sip from the water glass that had been left for him, and thanked everyone, again, for coming. His voice came out strained and high. Then he said something about the freezing weather outside, before remembering that his boss had already commented on that, too. He looked out at the room of expectant faces, cleared his throat, and decided to cut the small talk and just launch into his lecture.<br><br>As he did so, the lights went down, and a screen was lowered to his right.<br><br>"Dante, as you might know, had originally titled his book The Comedy of Dante Alighieri, A Florentine by birth but not in character. The title Divine Comedy only came later, when the book became regarded as a masterpiece. It's a work that can be approached in a thousand different ways, and over the centuries it has been," he said, his voice gaining strength once he was on firm and familiar ground. "But what we're going to focus on today is the use of natural imagery in the poem. And this Florentine edition which was recently donated to the Newberry collection-and which I think most of you have now seen in the central display case-is a particularly good way to do that."<br><br>He touched a button on the lectern's electronic panel and the first image-an etching of a deep forest, with a lone figure, head bent, entering a narrow path-appeared on the screen. "'In the middle of the journey of our life,'" he recited from memory, "'I came to myself in a dark wood where the straight way was lost.'" Looking up, he said, "With the possible exception of 'Jack and Jill went up the hill,' there is probably no line of poetry more famous and easily identifiable than that. And you will notice that right here, at the very start of the epic that is to follow, we have a glimpse of the natural world that is both realistic-Dante spends a terrible night in that wood-and metaphorical."<br><br>Turning to the etching, he elaborated on several of its most salient features, including the animals that animated its border-a leopard with a spotted coat, a lion, and a skulking wolf with distended jaws. "Confronted by these creatures, Dante pretty much turns tail and runs, until he bumps into a figure-who turns out of course to be the Roman poet Virgil-who offers to guide him 'through an eternal place where thou shalt hear the hopeless shrieks, shalt see the ancient spirits in pain so that each calls for a second death.'"<br><br>A new image flashed on the screen, of a wide river-Acheron with mobs of the dead huddled on its shores, and a shrouded Charon in the foreground, pointing with one bony finger at a long boat. It was a particularly well-done image and David noted several heads nodding with interest and a low hum of comments. He had thought there might be. This edition of the Divine Comedy was one of the most powerful he had ever seen, and he was making it his mission to find out who the illustrator had been. The title pages of the book had sustained such significant water and smoke damage that no names could be discerned. The book had also had to be intensively treated for mold, and many of the plates bore ineradicable green and blue spots the circumference of a pencil eraser.<br><br>But for David, such blemishes and signs of age only made the books and manuscripts he studied more precious and intriguing. The very fact that this book-nearly five hundred years old-had passed through so many unknown hands, and through so many different places, only lent it an air of mystery and importance. When he held it in his hands, he felt connected to that chain of unrecorded readers who had turned its pages before...perhaps in a palazzo in Tuscany, a garret in Paris, or a country seat in England. All he knew of the book's origins was that it had been donated to the Newberry by a local collector, who had wanted to be sure it would be properly restored, studied, and its treasures made available to all. David had felt honored to be entrusted with the task.<br><br>As he talked, he became not only more relaxed, but positively excited by the opportunity to share some of the discoveries he had made about the methodology that Dante had employed in his use of natural imagery. The poet often included animals in the text, but he also made regular use of the sun (a planet, according to the Ptolemaic system of the time) and the stars, the sea, the leaves of the trees, snow. Though the hall was dimly lighted, David did his best to maintain some eye contact with the audience as he elucidated these points, and midway through he noted a woman all in black, with a small black hat and a veil across her face, slip into the room and take a seat close to the door. The veil was what struck him. Who wore such things anymore, even in mourning? For a second he lost the thread of what he was saying and had to glance down at his notes to remember where he was.<br><br>"The meaning that Dante attaches to these natural elements changes, as we move from the Inferno to the Purgatorio to the Paradiso." He continued with his thesis, but his eye was drawn periodically to the mysterious woman in back, and for some reason it popped into his head that she might be the donor of the book, there to see what had become of it. As the images passed by on the screen to his right, he found himself explicating them as if he were talking chiefly to the woman concealed behind the veil. She remained completely still, her hands folded in her lap, her legs in black stockings, and it was all but impossible for him to figure out anything about her...most notably her age. There were moments he felt she was in her twenties, dressed up as if for a grim costume party, and other times when he suspected she was a more mature woman, perched primly, almost precariously, on the edge of the chair.<br><br>By the time he had shown his last illustration-a whirlwind of leaves, containing the Cumaean Sybil's prophecies-and wrap...</p><h2>Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet</h2><p>Warriors of the Himalayas explores each type in turn by presenting the finest and most unusual examples drawn from the collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art with key loans from museums in the United States and the United Kingdom, including the Smithsonian Institution, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Royal Armories Museum in Leeds, the Royal Museum in Edinburgh, and the British Museum.

Alternating passages with coauthor Wartenberg (Winning Is an Attitude, 1991), Cunningham describes growing up in a racially mixed Santa Barbara neighborhood as the youngest of four brothers, the oldest of whom was former NFL star Sam ``Bam'' Cunningham. A second-round draft pick in 1985, the author was starting games for the Eagles in just his second season; when Ron Jaworski was released in 1987, Cunningham was named the Eagles' top quarterback. His 1988 $4 million contract made him the highest paid player in the NFL and, in 1989, he was given a five-year extension worth $18- 22 million. Despite what the press reported in 1990 about Buddy Ryan's firing, Cunningham states that he in no way lobbied management to replace the coach with Rich Kotite--and that Ryan ``is the man who made me what I am today.'' That season saw the scrambling Cunningham (who prefers being tackled ``by a 190-pound cornerback'' to staying in the ``pocket where big, sloppy, nasty 300-pound guys hit you at full speed'') throw 30 touchdown passes and rush for 942 yards (``I amaze myself!''). He holds the all-time rushing record for quarterbacks, having managed in just seven seasons to break Fran Tarkenton's record. Cunningham sat out most of 1991 with a severe knee injury, and his comeback in 1992 was marked by extreme ups and downs including being benched in favor of the high-profile McMahon and catching some sharp criticism from his teammates regarding his ego. While Cunningham seemingly tries to respond to his critics here, not sidestepping the tough questions, his answers ring a little hollow and self-serving, even for a sports memoir. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>As quarterback for professional football's Philadelphia Eagles, Cunningham is renowned for his improvisational style. Here, he delivers a generally straightforward account of his rise to stardom. He focuses primarily on the field, reflecting on his development as a player and recounting major career milestones, including a highly publicized benching and the furor surrounding the firing of controversial head coach Buddy Ryan. Peppered throughout are pointed comments on teammates, opponents, coaches, the media, and his celebrity status.

Each year they are seen by millions of visitors, and they have become as integral a part of the Tower as its ancient stones. But their role is even more important than that&#x2014;legend has it that if the ravens should ever leave, the Tower will crumble into dust and great harm will befall the kingdom.</p><p>The responsibility for ensuring that such a disaster never comes to pass falls to one man: the Ravenmaster. The current holder of the position is Yeoman Warder Christopher Skaife, and in this fascinating, entertaining and touching book he memorably describes the ravens&#x2019; formidable intelligence, their idiosyncrasies and their occasionally wicked sense of humour. <em>The Ravenmaster</em> is a compelling, inspiring and irreverent story that will delight and surprise anyone with an interest in British history or animal behaviour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><strong>Christopher Skaife</strong>&nbsp;is Yeoman Warder (Beefeater) and Ravenmaster at the Tower of London.

But not as many are aware of the powerful family behind the world's largest chemical company. The Du Ponts are easily the richest family in America and one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the world. From their fortress-like complex of buildings in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, they direct the workings of a vast network of interlocking companies that encompasses the world. They rule the state of Delaware as their private duchy, and they influence and control the lives of thousands of employees and millions of citizens.<br>Here is the truly revealing story of this remarkable family, from the arrival in this country of Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, who was to found the firm that thought of itself as 'America's armorer, ' to the present governor of Delaware, Pierre S. ('Pete') du Pont IV, who many observers claim is already running for the 1988 presidential election.<br><br> Along the way you will meet a host of colorful and, in some cases, infamous characters: Henry du Pont, 'The General, ' who conceived and made a fortune from the Gunpowder Trust after the Civil War; Alfred I. du Pont, 'The Count of Florida', who was instrumental in developing as well as plundering the resources of that state; and his wife, Jessie, whose surviving brother, Edward Ball, refused to relinquish her trust fund, which she had left to charity, in order to amass another Du Pont fortune. And finally, Irving Shapiro, recent chairman of Du Pont Company and the first outsider to manage the notoriously clannish Du Pont empire, who is overseeing enormous changes in the company's direction and the nation's laws. The incredible deals, ploys, plots and manipulations which gained their empire for the Du Ponts, as well as the bitter feuds and struggles within the family, are rescued from the elaborate coverups and silences that the publicity-hating Du Ponts have imposed over the years are explored in detail.</p><p></p><h2>Textiles by William Morris and Morris &amp; Co., 1861-1940</h2><p>Book by Fairclough, Oliver</p><p></p><h2>Beyond This Point Are Monsters</h2><p>Spine and cover creased, page edges tanned.

A veteran of the 82nd Airborne, Ringo brings first-hand knowledge of military operations to his fiction.Fans of Hollywood-style blood-and-guts sci-fi as exemplified in the film Independence Day will enjoy this sequel to A Hymn Before Battle (2000). Ringo's army background gives his series all the flavor and excitement of the liveliest military SF, illustrating both the tactical and strategic levels of a near-future war that started on distant worlds and has now come to Earth. In A Hymn Before Battle, resourceful Captain Michael O'Neal almost single-handedly defeated the vicious centaurlike Posleen in battle, but with Earth hanging in the balance in this book, it will take more than one man to turn the tide. Ringo begins with long and detailed human preparations for the expected invasion, introducing an immense cast of civilians, veterans, grunts and high-level officers. But when the Posleen forces arrive earlier than expected, improvised plans must be launched without delay. The humans fight for the most part with modern-day weaponry, assisted by advanced artillery from the Galactic Federation allies who got them into the fight in the first place. The resulting carnage will please those who relish high body counts. Ringo's characters often walk a fine line between heroic and stereotypical, while his extended expository passages slow the story. Still, this novel should cement Ringo's reputation as one of the best new practitioners of military SF. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Vacation homes: A-frames, chalets, designs 480 to 3,238 sq. ft</h2><p>Book by Home Planners Inc</p><p></p><h2>Finding Ourselves after Darwin: Conversations on the Image of God, Original Sin, and the Problem of Evil</h2><p>A multinational team of scholars focuses on the interface between Christian doctrine and evolutionary scientific research, exploring the theological consequences for the doctrines of original sin, the image of God, and the problem of evil.

Building the Scientific Revolution.</h2><p>Today the 'two cultures' - art and science - have come to be treated as fundamentally opposed, their aims incompatible. Scientific research is castigated for its inhumane methods &amp; lack of moral responsibility, while art is treated as an enduring source of essential guidance to society's spiritual well-being. Lisa Jardine makes clear in this remarkable book that this is a distinction which is both artificial &amp; historically inaccurate. The intellectual revolution of the 17th &amp; early 18th eighteenth centuries was the single most formative event in Western history, bringing together the humanities &amp; natural sciences in an unprecedented ferment of conceptual &amp; practical creativity. She documents the forces for change which brought the human &amp; natural sciences together &amp; gave them shape. Each of her series of key components - among them, precise time measurement, enhanced astronomical observation, selective animal &amp; plant breeding &amp; technological advances in navigation - lays a crucial part of the foundations for modern thought. INGENIOUS PURSUITS brilliantly illuminates the practice of science, its impact on the emerging modern world &amp; its continuing relevance to society.</p><p>Lisa Jardine is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London. She is a regular contributor to radio (START THE WEEK) and TV programmes (QUESTION TIME), and she also writes and reviews for THE TIMES, OBSERVER and DAILY TELEGRAPH.&#39;Lisa Jardine has the knack of making science easy to understand. Her book brilliantly recaptures the excitement felt by seventeenth century scientists at the new world of objects they were finding and theorising.&#39; Roy Porter &#39;A fascinating book, the best introduction to date for the first scientists; for this is history written not backwards, in the quest of the origins of modern science, but with a blind eye to the future...&#39; David Wooton &#39;Lisa Jardine is a new star on England&#39;s literary and historical scene.&#39; LITERARY REVIEW &#39;INGENIOUS PURSUITS is an eminently readable history of the intellectual revolution of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that through it&#39;s author&#39;s spirited style well convey the excitement of those who were party to it.&#39; TLS &#39;Her [Jardine] history of those who built the first scientific revolution is well informed, rich in fascinating stories and eminently readable.&#39; SUNDAY TIMES &#39;By doing for science what she did for the arts in WORDLY GOODS, Professor Jardine... catalogues the extraordinary energy and ingenuity that went into the scientific advances of the European renaissance of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, one of the most formative periods of Western civilisation.&#39; OBSERVER &#39;Jardine&#39;s broad-ranging investigations bring the characters and their times to life in all their adventurous, opportunistic chance-taking glory.&#39; SCOTSMAN &#39;[A] superb and ebullient book.&#39; Elaine Showalter, NEW STATESMAN &#39;Where does curiosity stop and science begin? When is a gentleman&#39;s collection of curios a museum? What makes a navigational aid a scientific instrument? Questions of this sort attempt to separate science out from the rest of life--and Lisa Jardine has no time for them. Her latest book is instead a meticulous and sympathetic re-imagination of the lives of early scientists in the late 17th century. It conjures up a curious and engaging image of buccaneering science, serving its own more abstract instincts by supplying vital research to industry and the military. Jardine shows that science is a normal commercial activity, wedded inextricably to the pursuit of profit and military advantage. Our modern idea of it as an objective, pure and even spiritual exercise--and our disappointment and anger when scientists turn out to have paymasters we do not like--is the product of a very modern habit of putting science on a pedestal. While these topical issues inform Ingenious Pursuits, the book stays very much in its period. It is richly illustrated throughout, offering the reader a rare chance to acquire the feel and fascination of doing early science. But it is the individual stories that entice most--the founder of the British Museum collection whose fortune was founded on &#34;medicinal&#34; milk chocolate; Hooke and Wren&#39;s scheme to fashion out of a London rebuilt after the Great Fire a great laboratory, stocked with monumental telescopes. The heroes and heroines of Jardine&#39;s story are engaged, business-like entrepreneurs, not white- coated supermen, and, Jardine assures us, the same is true today.

Born in 1812, the illegitimate son of a wealthy Russian landowner, he became one of the most important revolutionary and intellectual figures of his time: as theorist, polemicist, propagandist, and political actor. Fifty years after his death, Lenin revered him as the father of Russian revolutionary socialism. Tolstoy said he had never met another man "with so rare a combination of scintillating brilliance and depth." His monumental autobiography is an unparalleled record of his&#x2014;and his century's&#x2014;remarkable life.<br><br>Herzen's story of his privileged childhood among the Russian aristocracy is lit with the insight of a great novelist. With a trained historian's sense of the interaction of people and events, he limns the grand line of revolutionary development from the earliest stirrings of Russian radicalism throughthe tumultuous ideological debates of the international. His close friends and enemies&#x2014;Marx, Wagner, Mill, Bakunin, Garibaldi, Kropotkin&#x2014;are brought brilliantly alive.

Take a sobering look at our lovely planet and realize how small and fragile it really is.YA. At first glance, Orbit might appear to be another glitzy coffee-table book with the rambling narrative so typical of National Geographic publications. Certainly astronaut Jay Apt has assembled what the authors describe as "the most important and beautiful photographs taken since humans first left Earth." Entertaining as the spectacular shots of our home planet are, however, the accompanying captions and chapter narratives give the full-page photographs an added immediacy that could only come from one who has actually been there. Brief historical and scientific commentary is enlivened with fascinating details. The organization of photographs and text makes Orbit a round-trip tour from blastoff to final approach along the blue-green waters of the Gulf Coast until Cape Canaveral looms into view. Readers can even keep track of the journey with the aid of miniature global maps on most pages. In addition to an index of places, there is an index to the photographs that provides exact cartographic location, date of the shot, type of camera, and lens and film used.?Cynthia J. Rieben, W. T.

Ten dollars, to be exact. Never mind what for. Okay, it&#39;s for low-fat Belldeloon cheese in a special just-for you serving size. Don&#39;t ask why. How are Ivy and Bean going to make ten dollars? Hey, maybe they should write a newspaper about Pancake Court and sell it! Great idea! And easy, too. All they have to do is snoop around the neighborhood. Wow...It&#39;s very interesting what they can find out. It&#39;s even more interesting when the neighbors read about it in the newspaper.</p><p>Annie Barrows started writing books when she was nine, but they never turned out the way she wanted, so she gave up on writing for twenty-five years. She&#39;s written a bunch of books for grown-ups, but Ivy and Bean is her first book for kids. Annie lives in Northern California with her husband and two daughters. One daughter is like Ivy and the other is like Bean.At lunchtime everyone has low-fat Belldeloon cheese &#x201c;in a special just-for-you serving size,&#x201d; except for BFFs Ivy and Bean. The appeal is not really in eating the cheese but in playing with its squishable, Silly Putty&#x2013;like wax case. In this eighth adventure in the tireless series, the slightly mischievous Ivy and Bean unite to raise money to buy their beloved cheese. Inspired by Bean&#x2019;s good-natured dad, they decide to write and sell subscriptions to a newspaper about their neighborhood of Pancake Court. When that turns out to be boring, the pair resorts to snooping in windows and stretching the truth. Enthusiastic illustrations heighten the comedic results.

Anthony&#x2014;was one of the most important leaders of the movement to gain American women the vote. But, as Vivian Gornick argues in this passionate, vivid biographical essay, Stanton is also the greatest feminist thinker of the nineteenth century. Endowed with a philosophical cast of mind large enough to grasp the immensity that women&#x2019;s rights addressed, Stanton developed a devotion to equality uniquely American in character. Her writing and life make clear why feminism as a liberation movement has flourished here as nowhere else in the world.<br><br>Born in 1815 into a conservative family of privilege, Stanton was radicalized by her experience in the abolitionist movement. Attending the first international conference on slavery in London in 1840, she found herself amazed when the conference officials refused to seat her because of her sex. At that moment she realized that &#x201c;In the eyes of the world I was not as I was in my own eyes, I was only a woman.&#x201d; At the same moment she saw what it meant for the American republic to have failed to deliver on its fundamental promise of equality for all. In her last public address, &#x201c;The Solitude of Self,&#x201d; (delivered in 1892), she argued for women's political equality on the grounds that loneliness is the human condition, and that each citizen therefore needs the tools to fight alone for his or her interests.<br><br>Vivian Gornick first encountered &#x201c;The Solitude of Self&#x201d; thirty years ago. Of that moment Gornick writes, &#x201c;I hardly knew who Stanton was, much less what this speech meant in her life, or in our history, but it I can still remember thinking with excitement and gratitude, as I read these words for the first time, eighty years after they were written, &#x2018;We are beginning where she left off.&#x2019; &#x201c;<br><br><i>The Solitude of Self</i> is a profound, distilled meditation on what makes American feminism American from one of the finest critics of our time.<br></p><p><b>Vivian Gornick</b>'s books include <i>Approaching Eye Level</i>, <i>The End of The Novel of Love</i>, and <i>The Situation and The Story</i>.

What a potent book this is!"&nbsp; --The New York Times<br><br><p>"The real story of this illuminating study is not only that of a brave American's fight for equality of the sexes, but of the human yearning to be truly free, and of the lonely, fearful struggle with society, and even with oneself, that such a noble goal entails." --Ronald Steel, author of <i>In Love With Night: The American Romance With Robert Kennedy</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Gornick's gorgeous prose brings alive the magnificent Elizabeth Cady Stanton in all her brilliance, complexity, and prescient understanding of the centrality of the 'woman question' to American democracy.

Not the movement for the vote, but the deeper wrestling with the obstacles to equality; religion, for example, and the solitude of the self.

It is at once a political adventure, a social comedy, and a passionate triangle. It is set in the 1990s in Botswana&#x2014;the African country Rush has indelibly made his own fictional territory.<br><br><b>Mortals</b> chronicles the misadventures of three ex-pat Americans: Ray Finch, a contract CIA agent, operating undercover as an English instructor in a private school, who is setting out on perhaps his most difficult assignment; his beautiful but slightly foolish and disaffected wife, Iris, with whom he is obsessively in love; and Davis Morel, an iconoclastic black holistic physician, who is on a personal mission to &#x201c;lift the yoke of Christian belief from Africa.&#x201d;<br><br>The passions of these three entangle them with a local populist leader, Samuel Kerekang, whose purposes are grotesquely misconstrued by the CIA, fixated as the agency is on the astonishing collapse of world socialism and the simultaneous, paradoxical triumph of radical black nationalism in South Africa, Botswana&#x2019;s neighbor. And when a small but violent insurrection erupts in the wild northern part of the country, inspired by Kerekang but stoked by the erotic and political intrigues of the American trio&#x2014;the outcome is explosive and often explosively funny.<br><br>Along the way, there are many pleasures. Letters from Ray&#x2019;s brilliantly hostile brother and Iris&#x2019;s woebegone sister provide a running commentary on contemporary life in America. Africa and Africans are powerfully evoked, and the expatriate scene is cheerfully skewered.<br><br>Through lives lived ardently in an unforgiving land, <b>Mortals</b> examines with wit and insight the dilemmas of power, religion, rebellion, and contending versions of liberation and love. It is a study of a marriage over time, and a man&#x2019;s struggle to find his way when his private and public worlds are shifting. It is Norman Rush&#x2019;s most commanding work.</p><p>Surely someone has already pointed out the irony of the surname Rush for a writer who can devote a long paragraph to uneven paving tiles. <i>Mortals</i>--the follow-up to Norman Rush's National Book Award-winning <i>Mating</i>--is a complex, unhurried tour de force; the beautifully rendered story of the end of a marriage. Ray and Iris Finch are white American expatriates in Botswana. A school principal and Milton scholar, Ray is also a contract agent for the CIA. But Ray's new boss doesn't want to see the gorgeous reports into which Finch has channeled all the talent and ambition that might otherwise have gone into poetry. He is asked to submit only his notes. This is clearly a demotion, and it occurs at the same moment that Ray's adored wife begins to develop feelings for her doctor, a charismatic black American with dangerous political ideas. Like many brilliant novels, <i>Mortals</i> has an Achilles heel. The book is too long by as much as 200 pages. Those pages aren't without interest, and if--like the author--you find the narrative voice of this novel compelling in itself, you will not mind the lengthy anecdotes, hair-splitting, and digressions that Rush indulges in. Other readers may do a little judicious skimming in the second half of the book and still experience the pleasures of this masterful and psychologically acute novel. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;Marvelous . . . a portrait of a marriage and a political thriller . . .

They are often photographed yet their words are seldom heard. <br> <br>Some began this way of life from childhood, others were civil servants, shop keepers, real estate agents, thieves... they left their families and jobs to become renunciants, sadhus. They refuse to work; and vow not to accept any wages. They pursue the path of liberation. <br> <br>A few accomplish rigorous austerities, but most of them dedicate themselves to non-action. In a world verging on its short term ecological doom and demographic tsunami, the sadhus are the messengers of a kind of freedom and moderation that our commercial civilization has forgotten, with its preaching of labour, consumption, economic growth and competition. <br> <br>Patrick Levy recounts their everyday lives, the respect they are given and how they make use of it, their teachings, their philosophy and the way they transform it into a lifestyle. <br> <br>'Sadhus' is a novel written in the form of a road movie.

The great fire of the Second World War has convulsed Europe and Asia. In its wake, Aldred Leith, an acclaimed hero of the conflict, has spent two years in China at work on an account of world-transforming change there. Son of a famed and sexually ruthless novelist, Leith begins to resist his own self-sufficiency, nurtured by war. Peter Exley, another veteran and an art historian by training, is prosecuting war crimes committed by the Japanese. Both men have narrowly escaped death in battle, and Leith saved Exley&#39;s life. The men have maintained long-distance friendship in a postwar loneliness that haunts them both, and which has swallowed Exley whole. Now in their thirties, with their youth behind them and their world in ruins, both must invent the future and retrieve a private humanity. Arriving in Occupied Japan to record the effects of the bomb at Hiroshima, Leith meets Benedict and Helen Driscoll, the Australian son and daughter of a tyrannical medical administrator. Benedict, at twenty, is doomed by a rare degenerative disease. Helen, still younger, is inseparable from her brother. Precocious, brilliant, sensitive, at home in the books they read together, these two have been, in Leith&#39;s words, delivered by literature. The young people capture Leith&#39;s sympathy; indeed, he finds himself struggling with his attraction to this girl whose feelings are as intense as his own and from whom he will soon be fatefully parted.</p><p>"<i>The Great Fire</i> is a brilliant, brave, and sublimely written novel that allows the literate reader 'the consolation of having touched infinity.'

I was stunned. These children were an enormous piece of the man I loved and yet had really nothing to do with me. How did this stepmother thing work? </p> <p>I quickly fell in love with Lorin's impish grin and McKenna's pudgy baby body, warm against my chest as I held her. I was completely captivated by my new and charming "instant family," but the children's mother, Dia, was a different story. We had a wary relationship, the edge of hostility between us only thinly veiled. I did my best to ignore her and focused instead on the two adorable children she'd borne. </p> <p>The children and I got along well, though Lorin was somewhat standoffish. Perhaps it was loyalty to his mother, or being a boy, or at four simply wanting more independence. McKenna, being so little, had no such qualms. She loved me and let me know it, unreservedly and with a sweetness and innocence that took my breath away. I couldn't resist her love and when I fell, I fell hard. Almost immediately, we formed our own mutual fan club�two hearts that beat as one. </p> <p>In fact, it was McKenna who proposed to me first. We sat together in an airport waiting room, on our way to visit Larry's parents. She was almost three, and she sat facing me in my lap, playing with my necklace and every so often looking into my face with worshipful eyes. I smiled at her, feeling the fullness of love for her present in my own heart. Larry sat beside us and Lorin was motoring around the rows of plastic seats, making engine noises with his mouth. To the casual observer, a typical young family. But we weren't a family because Larry hadn't popped the question yet. And although I didn't want to be pushy, we both knew my patience was wearing thin. What, I wondered, was he waiting for? </p> <p>Then McKenna pulled her pacifier out of her mouth and returning my smile, said brightly, "Will you marry me?" After a moment of shocked silence, we all laughed till our sides hurt. Me with delight, Larry with the release of tension and the children simply because the grown-ups were laughing. Happily, it didn't take Larry long to follow up with his own proposal. </p> <p>As time went on, I got used to part-time parenting�and having the children's mother as an unavoidable part of my life. I really liked Dia, but our positions seemed to dictate a certain grumpiness with each other that I did my best to squelch. Sometimes I had the guilty wish that the children's mother would simply disappear. A quick and painless illness and on her deathbed, she would make me promise to raise her children for her. Then the children could stay with us�truly be mine�and we could be a "real" family. </p> <p>Fortunately that never happened. I didn't really want her to die; I just was jealous that she'd had children with my husband. All right, so he was her husband at the time�it still rankled. </p> <p>I watched the children grow, changing from toddlers to schoolkids. And their mother and I continued our civilized and awkward interactions, arranging for the children to come and go and negotiating vacations and holiday schedules. </p> <p>My friends all told me that Larry should deal with his ex-wife, and for a while we tried that. But as an active and willing caregiver, I was involved with decisions, so Dia and I went back to our previous arrangement. And as the years went by, I noticed that our phone calls changed. I actually enjoyed talking to Dia about the kids. And I think she realized that there were very few people in the world who were as interested in, charmed by or concerned about her children as I was. We began a slow but perceptible metamorphosis that was completed the year Dia sent me a Mother's Day card, thanking me for "co-mothering" her children. </p> <p>That was the beginning of a new era for Dia and me. And while it hasn't always been perfect, I know now it's been extraordinary. I have a few thank-yous of my own: </p> <p>Thank you, Dia, for being big enough to share your children with me. If you hadn't, I would never have known what it was like to hold a sleeping infant and feel the complete trust displayed in the limp, silky-skinned limbs gathered carefully in my embrace. I wouldn't have had the opportunity to marvel at the twists and turns a little boy's mind makes as he tries to make sense of a large and complex universe. </p> <p>I would never have known that children could cry so loudly when their stomachs hurt or that after they threw up, they could smile so radiantly at you, the tears still wet on their cheeks, their pain already forgotten. </p> <p>I would never have watched a boy struggle to become his own person, or have been so closely involved with the painful and serious process of "growing a teenager." I would never have had the awe-inspiring privilege of watching that squirty twelve-year-old who could drive you wild with his questions turn into a heartbreakingly handsome hunk with the megawatt smile and charming personality. As he gets ready to leave for college, I know he will drive a new generation of women wild�for entirely different reasons. </p> <p>I wouldn't have felt the thrill of seeing our beautiful daughter on stage, expressing herself with a grace and depth of emotion that seemed too old for someone so young. Or had the distinctly undeserved (and guilty) thrill of vanity and pride when someone who didn't know us commented that McKenna looked like me. </p> <p>Thank you for making Christmas morning a communal occasion, so the children never had to feel divided on the holiday they held so dear. I looked around one year as we all sat around the tree, while the children delivered the gifts. There we were, you and your husband, Larry and me, the kids . . . and surprisingly, I felt at home. </p> <p>I understood then that you didn't have to disappear for us to be a real family. </p> <p><i>Carol Kline &nbsp; </i> </p> <p><i> </i> </p> (c)2000.

In a new Afterword to the paper edition, Lee pays tribute to the Congressional Black Caucus, for which she serves as chair during the 111th Congress, and reflects on the challenges that continue to face our nation at home and abroad.</p><p><b>Congresswoman Barbara Lee</b> was first elected to represent California's Ninth District in 1998. She served as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus in the 111th session of Congress.My favorite brave American, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, has again done a courageous thing: she has written a personal and powerful story about her life, from her childhood in El Paso, Texas to her extraordinary present day position as U.S. Congresswoman from the 9th district of Northern California. <i>Renegade For Peace and Justice</i> demonstrates how her faith in her God, her values, and her common sense caused her to say no to the Bush Administration's demand, following the attacks of 9/11, that Congress turn over its constitutional powers to declare war to the President, George W. Bush; giving him a blank check to fund endless aggression against a country that was not responsible for the attacks. Hers was the only dissenting vote. For the layperson this book is a wonderful way to begin to understand how our political system works, or of late, doesn't work, because of Lee's ability to explain, in practical terms, her own positions and those of other members of Congress. Lee is not only a hero and a champion of the marginalized and under-represented, she is also a marvelous teacher. (Alice Walker, poet; activist; author of The Color Purple)<br><br>Barbara Lee's honest, personal, and very American story will inspire every reader plus generations of young leaders. Yes, Robert Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., and others have led us by their public examples; but in showing us the links between public and private life, Barbara Lee ushers us into a new era that allows leaders to be whole people. (<i>Gloria Steinem</i>)<br><br>Barbara Lee, a renegade for justice, fearless but compassionate, sensitive but smart, expresses in this illustrious book, the courage of Esther, the militancy of Deborah, and the faith of Mary. Her undying commitment to her African motherland and to marginalized people everywhere reminds us of her kinship with both Mother Teresa and her role model, Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. Readers of this book will want to join Congresswoman Lee as renegades for the cause of justice anywhere and everywhere. (Dr. J. Alfred Smith Sr., Senior Pastor, Allen Temple Baptist Church)<br><br>Some of the poorest people in the world will never know the name Barbara Lee, yet owe their lives to her determination in the fight against AIDS. Her sense of justice&#x2015;and injustice&#x2015;runs about as deep as it's possible to go. (Bono, lead singer of U2 and co-founder of the anti-poverty organization ONE)<br><br>When our government shifts from the course charted by our constitution, we can always count on Rep. Barbara Lee to sound the warning bell. Barbara is intimately guided by her sense of direction; when the tide of public opinion runs in the opposite way, Barbara's internal compass guides her through fog that can cloud the sharpest minds. (Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA), Chair, Asian Pacific American Caucus)<br><br>Barbara Lee's exciting autobiography gives us hints why she is such an extraordinary, unique leader. She has lived "Yes. We Can! Si Se Puede!" We can all learn and be grateful for Barbara Lee's life. (Dolores Huerta, president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation and cofounder of United Farm Workers)<br><br>Most memoirs by Members of Congress are safe, tepid retellings of hardscrabble upbringings or glossing-over of troubled pasts. Not so in the candid new book by Rep. Barbara Lee, which delves into raw emotional territory from the California Democrat's past, including a secret marriage, a clandestine abortion, an abusive marriage and even an LSD trip forced upon her by her violent ex-husband....Still, the story ends in triumph, and Lee remembers her career in the House and the support, both public and private, that she's gotten for her controversial stance as the sole Member of Congress who voted against the use of force after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. We do love a happy ending. (<i>Roll Call, July 2008</i>)<br><br>Her passion for public service brought her into the orbit of the Black Panther Party and later more mainstream politics as she developed her iconoclastic views on how to serve. She details the challenges of getting ahead in politics, relying on a strong faith, and maintaining the courage to stand up for what she thinks is right. (September 2008 <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>A refreshingly frank self-examination by a public figure. (Tammerlin Drummond <i>Contra Costa Times, "Public Lawmaker Shows her Private Side" from November 12, 2008</i>)<br><br>It's striking to read....Lee's story, told in an earnest, almost reticent way, is startling: who would have thought that this person who has at times been vilified as a left-wing radical is trying to live what she was taught by nuns and in her Methodist Sunday school? (<i>Shelf Awareness, November 2008</i>)</p><h2>The Dragon and The Djinn</h2><p>Venturing out on a supposedly simple quest to the Holy Land, the Dragon Knight encounters such unexpected challenges as pirates, sea giants, and the legendary Djinn, all of which threaten to make his voyage the most dangerous quest known to man or dragon. Reprint.</p><p><p>Paul Boehmer is a seasoned actor who has appeared on Broadway, film, and television, including The Thomas Crown Affair and All My Children. Coinciding with another of his passions, sci-fi, Paul has been cast in various roles in many episodes of Star Trek.</p>Dickson's style of fantasy hearkens back to the era before both the glossy epic approach of Robert Jordan or Terry Brooks and the pseudo-postmodern slickness of Ellen Kushner or Pamela Dean, but it has its own special charms. In this new story about James and Angela Eckert (following The Dragon, the Earl, and the Troll), the author's meticulous historical research salvages what in the hands of a lesser talent could have been a pedestrian work. The Eckerts are 20th-century humans trapped in the 14th century, where Jim has discovered that he possesses magical powers. Here, Jim agrees to help his friend Sir Brian Neville-Smythe find the father of Brian's beloved Geronde, so that Brian and Geronde may wed. The father was last known to be in the Muslim land of Palmyra, and Dickson's fascination with the cultures of that area proves infectious. While the adventures here are cut from standard fantasy cloth?kidnappings, caravans and sorcery abound?the detailing is marvelous. Also appealing are Jim's pet hobgoblin, Hob, and the djinn named Kelb, who generally appears in the form of a small, mangy dog; both provide comic diversion. The characters may be secondary to the historical re-creation?Angela Eckert is especially ill-used in this volume?but those looking for fantasy in the mode of L. Sprague de Camp or L.E. Modesitt should delight in this book. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Get Out of Your Own Way at Work...And Help Others Do the Same: Conquer Self-Defeating Behavior on the Job</h2><p>Shares practical recommendations for employees and managers on how to overcome self-sabotaging behaviors that can compromise career advancement and satisfaction, in a guide that addresses forty self-defeating actions including fear of change, failure to delegate, and expecting too much. Reprint. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Corporate consultant Mark Goulston, M.D., has helped Fortune 500 executives, managers, and line workers achieve success. Selected as one of America's top psychiatrists for 2004-2005, he writes "The Leading Edge" column for <i>Fast Company /i&gt; magazine, is an expert commentator, and co-authored <i>Get Out of Your Own Way</i>.</i>This follow-up to 1996's Get Out of Your Own Way diagnoses 40 business situations in which workers exhibit symptoms of self-defeating behavior, from "Not Being Able to Take No for an Answer" and "Being Competent but Out of Touch" to "Not Delegating" and "Assuming Others Understand You." Goulston's focus, however, is not on workplace effectiveness but on "earning self-esteem-and its twin sister, success." He devotes a chapter to each workplace issue: first, highlighting a case study that refers to a client from his consulting practice or, tangentially, to one of his hospital patients and, then, explaining how to remedy the behavior. In addition, each chapter is topped off with an aphoristic "Usable Insight" and a to-do list of "Action Steps." People are inclined to commit "hari-kari at work," Goulston says, because of "fearful aggression" and "fearful avoidance," two traits that he traces back to humans' "early-neural, unthinking, animal nature." While his insights are pedestrian-his advice can be boiled down to "be more self-aware"-the structure of the book makes it easy to cherry pick chapters that may apply to you.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As the case takes on an international dimension, problems accumulate. The detectives wonder if the murder is connected to a series of vicious attacks on the rail link that is being built by British navvies under the direction of a British construction engineer.

Taking matters into his own paws, he buries his family's scrubbing brush in the backyard and runs away from home before they can wrangle him into the tub. Harry gets dirty playing in the street, dirtier at the railroad, and dirtier still playing tag with the other dogs. When sliding down the coal chute, he actually changes from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots! Of course, by the time he gets home he is completely unrecognizable to his family--even when he does all his clever flip-flopping tricks. In a stroke of doggy genius, he unearths the bath brush, begs for a bath, and the rest is history. Youngsters will completely relate to the urge to rebel, the thrill of getting dirty, and, finally, the reassurance of family. Gene Zion and Margaret Bloy Graham's <i>Harry the Dirty Dog</i>, first published in 1956 and now rereleased with splashes of color added by the artist herself, is one of those picture books that children never forget.

For 1,350 miles at a rate of 14 miles a day, Fiennes and his partner Dr. Michael Stroud trudged across Antarctica. But the expedition's world records for both the longest unsupported polar journey and the first unsupported crossing of Antarctica came at an incredible cost. Each pulling a 500-pound sled while encountering cavernous crevasses and bitter blizzards with temperatures at -86[degree]F, the two men faced gangrene, altitude sickness, starvation, hypothermia, and equipment failure that nearly claimed their lives long before they reached the South Pole. The tortuous trek took a mental toll as well. Tensions turned to frustrations that were taken out on each other, and by journey's end the two good friends were deeply antagonistic.<br>With an honest and vivid narrative, Fiennes takes the reader through the coldest land on earth and describes what it takes to survive a monumental physical and mental challenge.</p><p>``The world's greatest explorer'' bruises his way across Antarctica on foot, and without any external support, thank you very much. Fiennes (The Feather Men, 1993) is well-known in polar circles for having made numerous firsts: Pole-to-Pole circumnavigation, trans-Antarctic crossing, unsupported journey to the South Pole. Here he recounts, in his rather swaggerish, old-boy style, his tramp with Mike Stroud (see Mike Stroud, Shadows on the Wasteland, below) across the southernmost continent, dragging all they would need behind them in sleds (a mere 500 pounds when full) for 1,350 miles. The trip would be another first--if they survived. This was a long, mean trek across a brutal landscape only too happy to seal their doom, if not from a fall down a crevasse, then by the sheer wasting of their bodies. There are the obligatory horrifying descriptions of body rot (he refers to his hands as ``senseless lumps of bloodless meat'' and his nose as a suppurating pineapple) and some fine description of the terrain and strange weather phenomena, and the narrative is laced with excerpts from the diaries of explorers who went before them. Fiennes comes across as a bit of a bully (he does a very neat and quiet job of making Stroud out to be a weenie), prone to God-and-country bluster, but for all his ramrod-straight comportment, he does have a sense of humor, tongue often firmly in cheek--it's probably frozen there. Therein lies the success of his story: a desperate, thrilling adventure told with enough drollery to make it believable, and the haughty Fiennes a mere mortal. And bully for them--they made it. A cracking account of one hazardous march, in the classic stiff-lipped style. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Not content with his record-setting exploits of polar travel--including the first Pole to Pole circumnavigation (1979-1982)--Fiennes set out from Chile in November 1992 to make an unsupported crossing of Antarctica. His companion was Mike Stroud, who would record physiological data. Each man pulled a 485-pound sledge containing all the supplies they would require for their 1500-mile journey, much of it at altitudes above 10,000 feet. By the time they reached the South Pole in mid-January, they had each lost 25% of their body weight. Stroud was vulnerable to hypothermia, and both men were suffering from frostbite and wind- and sunburn. On Day 83, now on half rations, they faced a 9000-foot descent on ice and in gale-force winds; next they traversed dangerous crevasse fields. On Day 95--February 12, 1993--having reached the Ross Ice Shelf, they summoned a plane. This epic journey tested both body and mind. With a foreword by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, Fiennes ( To the Ends of the Earth ) offers another gripping account of endurance and adventure. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Black Is the Body: Stories from My Grandmother&#39;s Time, My Mother&#39;s Time, and Mine</h2><p><b>An extraordinary, exquisitely written memoir (of sorts) that looks at race--in a fearless, penetrating, honest, true way--in twelve telltale, connected, deeply personal essays that explore, up-close, the complexities and paradoxes, the haunting memories and ambushing realities of growing up black in the South with a family name inherited from a white man, of getting a PhD from Yale, of marrying a white man from the North, of adopting two babies from Ethiopia, of teaching at a white college and living in America's New England today. From the acclaimed editor of <i>Remember Me to Harlem: The Letters of Langston Hughes and Carl Van Vechten</i> ("A major contribution," Henry Louis Gates; "Magnificent," <i>Washington Post</i>).</b><br><br>"I am black--and brown, too," writes Emily Bernard. "Brown is the body I was born into. Black is the body of the stories I tell."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the storytelling, and the mystery of Bernard's storytelling, of getting to the truth, begins with a stabbing in a New England college town. Bernard writes how, when she was a graduate student at Yale, she walked into a coffee shop and, along with six other people, was randomly attacked by a stranger with a knife ("I remember making the decision not to let the oddness of this stranger bother me"). "I was not stabbed because I was black," she writes (the attacker was white), "but I have always viewed the violence I survived as a metaphor for the violent encounter that has generally characterized American race relations. There was no connection between us, yet we were suddenly and irreparably bound by a knife, an attachment that cost us both: him, his freedom; me, my wholeness."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bernard explores how that bizarre act of violence set her free and unleashed the storyteller in her ("The equation of writing and regeneration is fundamental to black American experience"). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She writes in <i>Black Is the Body</i> how each of the essays goes beyond a narrative of black innocence and white guilt, how each is anchored in a mystery, and how each sets out to discover a new way of telling the truth as the author has lived it. "Blackness is an art, not a science. It is a paradox: intangible and visceral; a situation and a story. It is the thread that connects these essays, but its significance as an experience emerges randomly, unpredictably . . . Race is the story of my life, and therefore black is the body of this book."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what most interests Bernard is looking at "blackness at its borders, where it meets whiteness in fear and hope, in anguish and love."</p><p>EMILY BERNARD was born and grew up in Nashville, Tennessee, and received her PhD in American studies from Yale University. She has been the recipient of grants from the Ford Foundation, the NEH, and a W. E. B. Du Bois Resident Fellowship at Harvard University.

It was 2001, and I was recovering from surgery on my lower bowel, which had been damaged in a stabbing. A friend, a writer, came to visit me in the hospital and suggested not only that there was a story to be told about the violence I had survived, but also that my body itself was trying to tell me some�thing, which was that it was time to face down the fear that had kept me from telling the story of the stabbing, as well as other stories that I needed to tell.<br><br> I began to write essays. The first one I published was &#x201c;Teaching the N-Word.&#x201d; Over the next few years, more essays followed, along with several attempts to write about the stabbing. I couldn&#x2019;t tell that story yet because I didn&#x2019;t know what it meant. It took seven more years for me to understand that the experience of being at the wrong end of a hunting knife was only the situation, not the story itself; it was the stage, not the drama. In <i>The Situation and the Story: The Art of Personal Narrative, </i>Vivian Gornick writes: &#x201c;The situation is the context or circumstance, sometimes the plot; the story is the emotional experience that preoccupies the writer: the insight, the wisdom, the thing one has come to say.&#x201d;<br><br> The setting of &#x201c;Scar Tissue,&#x201d; which is the essay I even�tually wrote about being stabbed, is my gut; the blood let flow by the knife is the trail I followed until I discovered the story, which is the mystery of storytelling itself, and how hard it is to tell the whole truth. Each essay in this book is anchored in this mystery, in blood. They are also rooted in contradictions, primary among them being that the stabbing unleashed the storyteller in me. In more than one way, that bizarre act of violence set me free. <br><br> But, of course, the stabbing has been a source of mis�ery as well as opportunity. For instance, I suffered from recurrent, excruciating stomach pain for many years before another trip to the hospital revealed that I had developed adhesions in my bowel. The surgeon was able to untangle my intestines and scar tissue, but he warned me that the adhesions would return. There was nothing I could do to prevent or predict them. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just unlucky,&#x201d; he said sympathetically. The pain, he assured me, would be ran�dom and severe. It did return, thundered, again, through�out my body, and sent me back to the hospital, where a third surgeon ceded to the inherent mystery of the malady and confessed that medicine was more art than science. The gift of his honesty was, to me, as valuable as any solu�tion to the problem would have been. <br><br> Once I accepted the randomness of the situation in my bowel, life took on a new urgency, and so did the desire to understand it. I turned to art over science, story over solu�tion. I found a voice. The book imagined in 2001 began to take shape in a need to know, to explore, to understand, before it was too late. Insofar as the personal essay is, at heart, an attempt to grasp the mysteries of life, the form made sense to me on a visceral level. The need to under�stand, in fact, was what engendered the stabbing in the first place: I met the knife head on. Something in me just needed to know.<br><br> Each essay in this book was born in a struggle to find a language that would capture the totality of my experi�ence, as a woman, a black American, a teacher, writer, mother, wife, and daughter. I wanted to discover a new way of telling; I wanted to tell the truth about life as I have lived it. That desire evolved into this collection, which includes a story about adoption that is as pragmatic as it is romantic; a portrait of interracial marriage that is absent of hand-wringing; and a journey into the word &#x201c;nigger&#x201d; that includes as much humor as grief. These stories grew into an entire book meant to contribute something to the American racial drama besides the enduring narrative of black innocence and white guilt. That particular narrative is not false, of course, which accounts for its endurance, but there are other true stories to tell, stories steeped in defiance of popular assumptions about race, whose con�tours are shaped by unease with conventional discussions about race relations. These other true stories I needed to explore, but I was mainly driven by a need to engage in what Zora Neale Hurston calls &#x201c;the oldest human longing&#x2014;self-revelation.&#x201d; The only way I knew how to do this was by letting the blood flow, and following the trail of my own ambivalence.<br><br> I was not stabbed because I was black, but I have always viewed the violence I survived as a metaphor for the violent encounter that has generally characterized Ameri�can race relations. The man who stabbed me was white. But more meaningful to me than his skin was the look in his eyes, which were vacant of emotion. There was no connection between us, no common sphere, yet we were suddenly and irreparably bound by a knife, an attachment that cost us both: him, his freedom; me, my wholeness. Revisiting that wound has been a way of putting myself back together. The equation of writing and regeneration is fundamental in black American experience. So, if race was not an essential factor in what brought me into contact with a hunting knife, I have certainly treated the wound with the salve that I inherited from people whose experi�ences of blackness shaped their lives as fully and poetically as it has shaped mine. I am most interested in blackness at its borders, where it meets whiteness, in fear and hope, in anguish and love, just as I am most drawn to the line between self and other, in family, friendship, romance, and other intimate relationships.<br><br> Blackness is an art, not a science. It is a paradox: intan�gible and visceral; a situation and a story. It is the thread that connects these essays, but its significance as an experi�ence emerges sometimes randomly and unpredictably in life as I have lived it. It is inconsistent, continuously in flux, and yet also a constant condition that I carry in and on my body. It is a condition that encompasses beauty, misery, wonder, and opportunity. In its inherent contra�dictions, utter mysteries, and bottomlessness as a reservoir of narratives, race is the story of my life, and therefore black is the body of this book.</p><h2>Pagan Survivals, Superstitions, Popular Cultures (Studies and Texts)</h2><p>&#34;Detailed study of early mediaeval ecclesiastical texts from 500-1000 AD for evidence of popular paganism and superstition.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Business Adventures [Sep 23, 2014] Brooks, John</h2><p>What do the $350 million ford motor company disaster known as the edsel, the fast and incredible rise of xerox, and the unbelievable scandals at general electric and texas gulf sulphur have in common? each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety.

As the 1993 Nobel Prize winner shows in this slight but powerful story, many forces - economic, sociological, psychological - combined to reinforce racism and sexism before they were institutionalized. &#34;A Mercy&#34; is set amid the Bermuda Triangle of trade that fueled the pre-colonial trans-Atlantic economy: Europeans enslaved Africans and took them to the West Indies, where they were traded for rum and molasses, which was delivered to New England. The wealth created then returned to the Old World. In 1676, after a restive slave population incited rebellion in the mid-Atlantic region, new laws were put in place to tighten the gentry&#39;s control over blacks, mulattoes and freedmen. The willful exploitation of human capital was fast becoming fundamental to the flow of commerce. In Morrison&#39;s novel, this nasty business sits uneasily with Jacob Vaark, an up-from-the-bootstraps entrepreneur of Dutch-English heritage who represents the European immigrant (white, male, ambitious). Vaark, eager to earn his fortune along the Eastern Seaboard, represents the troubled conscience of the nation that&#39;s yet to emerge.</p><p></p><h2>Karate: The Art of &#34;Empty Hand&#34; Fighting</h2><p>The first complete and authoritative book to give a sober and systematic presentation of karate, the amazing Oriental sport and art of unarmed self-defense.

Some of these diverse Algonquian-speaking peoples acknowledged the overlordship of the Piscataways, the largest group of the Conoys, others acknowledged the authority of the paramount chief Powhatan, and still others, like the Patawomekes, acknowledged no ruler greater than their own. The rise and fall of these polities is the subject of Commoners, Tribute, and Chiefs. Using an innovative combination of archaeology, anthropology, and ethno-history, Stephen Potter traces the rise of one Indian group, the Chicacoans, whose domain on the south shore of the Potomac straddled the boundary between the Powhatans and the Conoys. By presenting a case study of the Chicacoans from A.D. 200 to the early seventeenth century, Potter offers readers a window onto the development of Algonquian culture in the Chesapeake and illuminates the responses of its constituent societies to the invading Europeans. He examines the stratification of individual chiefdoms into elites and masses of tribute-paying commoners, and he demonstrates the progressive consolidation of Algonquian peoples in the century preceding the European influx. While most previous scholarship on the Indians of the Potomac has centered on the historic accounts of Captain John Smith and his contemporaries, Potter draws extensively on a wealth of materials encountered during his years of research. His fascinating narrative succeeds both as a detailed archaeological and ethnohistorical studyof the Chicacoans and as a comprehensive interpretation of Algonquian culture.<p>Stephen R.

The story of the gene begins in an obscure Augustinian abbey in Moravia in 1856, where a monk stumbles on the idea of a unit of heredity . It intersects with Darwin s theory of evolution, and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms post-war biology. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality, temperament, choice and free will. Above all, this is a story driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds from Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel to Francis Crick, James Watson and Rosalind Franklin, and the thousands of scientists still working to understand the code of codes. This is an epic, moving history of a scientific idea being brought to life, by the author of The Emperor of All Maladies. But woven through The Gene, like a red line, is also an intimate history the story of Mukherjee s own family and its recurring pattern of mental illness, reminding us that genetics is vitally relevant to everyday lives. These concerns reverberate even more urgently today as we learn to read and write the human genome unleashing the potential to change the fates and identities of our children. Majestic in its ambition, and unflinching in its honesty, The Gene gives us a definitive account of the fundamental unit of heredity and a vision of both humanity s past and future.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> In 2010, Siddhartha Mukherjee was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his book <em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em>, a &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of cancer. Here, he follows up with a biography of the gene&#x2014;and <em>The Gene</em> is just as informative, wise, and well-written as that first book. Mukherjee opens with a survey of how the gene first came to be conceptualized and understood, taking us through the thoughts of Aristotle, Darwin, Mendel, Thomas Morgan, and others; he finishes the section with a look at the case of Carrie Buck (to whom the book is dedicated), who eventually was sterilized in 1927 in a famous American eugenics case. Carrie Buck&#x2019;s sterilization comes as a warning that informs the rest of the book. This is what can happen when we start tinkering with this most personal science and misunderstand the ethical implications of those tinkerings. Through the rest of <em>The Gene</em>, Mukherjee clearly and skillfully illustrates how the science has grown so much more advanced and complicated since the 1920s&#x2014;we are developing the capacity to directly manipulate the human genome&#x2014;and how the ethical questions have also grown much more complicated. We could ask for no wiser, more fascinating and talented writer to guide us into the future of our human heredity than Siddhartha Mukherjee. <em>--Chris Schluep</em>Siddhartha Mukherjee is a cancer physician and researcher, a stem cell biologist and a cancer geneticist.

Coll is at the height of his talents in this &#x201c;riveting&#x201d; tale of one of the most spectacular&#x2014;and catastrophic&#x2014;corporate takeovers of all time (<i>Newsday</i>).<br> &nbsp;<br> As the head of a sprawling oil empire, J. Paul Getty was once the world&#x2019;s richest man. But by 1984, eight years after his death, Getty&#x2019;s legacy was in tatters: His children were locked in a bitter feud over the family trust and the company he founded was riven by boardroom turmoil. Then Pennzoil made an agreement with Getty&#x2019;s son, Gordon, to purchase Getty Oil. It was a done deal&#x2014;until Texaco swooped in to claim the $10 billion prize.<br> &nbsp;<br> What followed was an epic legal battle that pit &#x201c;good ole boy&#x201d; J. Hugh Liedtke of Pennzoil against the Wall Street brokers behind Texaco&#x2019;s offer. The scandalous details of the case would shock the business world and change the landscape of the oil industry forever.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a large cast of colorful characters and the dramatic pacing of a novel, <i>The Taking of Getty Oil </i>is a &#x201c;suspenseful&#x201d; and &#x201c;always intriguing&#x201d; chronicle of one of the most fascinating chapters in American corporate history (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>).<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Steve Coll is a staff writer at the<i> New Yorker</i>, the dean of the Columbia Journalism School, and the bestselling author of seven books. Previously he served as president of the New America Foundation and worked for two decades at the<i> Washington Post</i>, where he won the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism for a four-part series on the Securities and Exchange Commission during Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s presidency. The award-winning series became the basis for <i>Eagle on the Street</i> (1991), coauthored with David A. Vise. Coll&#x2019;s other books include New York Times Notable Book<i> The Deal of the Century </i>(1998); <i>Ghost Wars </i>(2004), winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction; <i>The Bin Ladens </i>(2009), winner of the PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award for Nonfiction; and <i>Private Empire </i>(2012), winner of the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.<br> &nbsp;The financial disarray in which J. Paul Getty's death in 1976 left his family and the Getty Oil Company has led to sibling contention, corporate intrigue, courtroom high drama and, most recently, to an unprecedented $11-billion damage judgment over the Texaco-Pennzoil acquisition. Using "reconstructed dialogue" and suspenseful narrative, Washington Post financial writer Coll spins the story of family trustee Gordon Getty who sows confusion; a beset Getty Oil management; Texas oil-patch "good ole boy" Hugh Liedtke of Pennzoil fulfilling his dream to buyout Getty, only to be outmaneuvered by Texaco's Wall Street merger-brokersbut eventually winning in a down-home jury trial the biggest civil monetary damage award ever. Coll's behind-the-scenes account of investment banking and legal high jinks is at times startling and always intriguing.

She lives in West London.PreSchool-Grade 1 A rosy, fat-cheeked little girl narrates 18 simple poems about the weather and the seasons, describing experiences with mud, blossoms, water, and sand with rhythmic simplicity. While the poems are pleasant and evoke the images a child might have of weather and seasons, it is Hughes' realistic pictures which make this book. Readers not only come to know the seasons through natural data but also come to know the small narrator's family and her world. Children will enjoy watching for the narrator's baby brother, her parents, her cat and dog, and her special toys in the half-page watercolor paintings and the small detailed pictures which surround the text. Seasonal poems are clumped together and set off by a double-page spread which highlights people and their activities in each season. The busy spring pictures, full of people gardening, cleaning, and hanging out of windows to talk and enjoy the weather, evoke the sense of freedom of that season after a long winter. While the poems would work well in preschool story hour sessions on seasons, the detailed pictures cry out for a lap or occasions in which one or several children sit down and pore over the book.

In the 1900s, America did indeed live up Garfield's prophesy by studiously measuring everything from population growth and occupational inclination to crime trends and food fads. <i>The First Measured Century</i>, produced in conjunction with a PBS special of the same name, expertly catalogs and analyzes the "numerical thinking" that has subsequently taken place.<p> Authors Theodore Caplow, Louis Hicks, and TV host Ben Wattenberg are all accomplished social scientists who have collectively produced dozens of books, articles, and television shows on the trends these statistics amplify. Here, they compile statistics derived from government sources and independent polling data into sections on work, education, family, religion, money, politics, business, and more. Each is further divided into single-page essays that begin with one overarching theme ("The concentration of working women in a few occupations diminished as they found employment throughout the economy") and conclude with charts and graphs that underscore the point (in this case, precisely how women left farming, domestic, and factory work from 1900 through 1998 for clerical and sales jobs, teaching, nursing, and other professional occupations).

Quoting such folk should make for some intellectual and cultural fireworks, but the main problem with this hefty compendium is Buckley himself. Wrapping the edited snippets of conversations into his running commentary, he retrospectively uses his guests as a sounding-board to present his opinions on politics, the communist threat, capital punishment, crime, the 1960s ("The Kid Years") and religion. James Baldwin, George McGovern, Jesse Jackson and William Kunstler all get their comeuppance. Readers receptive to Buckley's conservative perspective may glide through his shooting-gallery; others will wish there had been less editorializing and more excerpts from the televised verbal combat. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book, highlights from the 23-year-old Firing Line TV series, will be a joy for anyone who delights in the raised eyebrows and eruditely crafted salvos at guests who dare to be less doctrinaire conservative than host Buckley. The book's pages read like a Who's Who of luminaries in politics, the arts, and journalism, including George McGovern, Barry Goldwater, presidents from Nixon to Reagan, and a number of heads of states of other nations. Most of the major social and political issues of the decades involved are scrutinized; but the real pleasure of this work is Buckley's artful commentary in which he illustrates "manifest evasiveness" in some of his guests and "fine reasoning" in others.

The bad guys (O'Malley, Bavasi, and Durocher) are clearly identified, as are the good guys (Branch Rickey and all the Dodger players). The narrative includes copious commentary by most of the major players associated with the integration of baseball and the Dodgers' winning of their first-ever World Series. Raymond Todd tells the story well. Without much vocal dramatizing he puts the listener in the middle of Irish-Italian-Jewish Brooklyn and creates a range of voices that move the narrative forward. Each voice is immediately identifiable and convincing. An interesting listen for fans of baseball history.

Organized alphabetically for easy reference, Edward Callary&#x2019;s concise entries reveal the stories behind such intriguing names as Fussville, Misha Mokwa, Couderay, and Thiry Daems. Fun to read and packed with information, <i>Place Names of Wisconsin</i> is a must-have for anyone interested in Wisconsin and Midwest history, language, geography, and culture&#x2014;or anyone who simply wonders &#x201c;why did they name it that?&#x201d;</p><p>Edward Callary is a professor emeritus of linguistics at Northern Illinois University and the past president of both the American Name Society and the North Central Name Society.

It explores the various ways in which, in order to affirm an unlimited creative power, Deleuze proceeds to dissolve whatever might restrict or mediate its expression, including the organisms, objects, representations, identities, and relations that this power generates along the way.<br><br>Rather than a theorist of material complexity or relational difference, <i>Out of this World</i> argues that Deleuze is better read as a spiritual and extra-worldly philosopher.&nbsp;His philosophy leaves little room for processes of social or historical transformation, and still less for political relations of conflict or solidarity.<br><br>Michel Foucault famously suggested that the 20th century would be known as &#x2018;Deleuzian&#x2019;; this sympathetic but uncompromising new critique suggests that our Deleuzian century may soon be coming to a close.</p><p><b>Peter Hallward</b> teaches at the Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London. He is the author of several books including <i>Absolutely Postcolonial</i>, <i>Badiou: A Subject to Truth,</i> <i>Out of This World: Deleuze and the Philosophy of Creation</i>, and <i>Damming the Flood.</i>&#x201c;This is a timely, provocative and remarkably engaging interpretation of Deleuze, based on an impressive mastery of his work. It is clearly written and exceptionally accessible, and should appeal as much to readers new to Deleuze&#x2019;s philosophy as to those already familiar with his work.&#x201d;&#x2014;Daniel W.

Her husband, whom she met in Paris, is a professor at another private university. He is having an affair with a much younger woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> In addition to her husband&#x2019;s infidelity, Mitsuki must deal with her ailing eighty-something mother, a demanding, self-absorbed woman who is far from the image of the patient, self-sacrificing Japanese matriarch. Mitsuki finds herself dreaming of the day when her mother will finally pass on. While doing everything she can to ensure her mother&#x2019;s happiness, she grows weary of the responsibilities of a doting daughter and worries she is sacrificing her chance to find fulfillment in her middle age.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Inheritance from Mother</i> not only offers insight into a complex and paradoxical culture, but is also a profound work about mothers and daughters, marriage, old age, and the resilience of women.</p><p><b>Minae Mizumura</b>&nbsp;is one of the most important writers in Japan today.

We can officially call that our last run before Nationals. At least until we hit Dallas.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel released a sigh, her shoulders slumping in relief.<br> <br>Around her, tired whoops and clapping echoed through the gym, everyone breaking off to find their water bottles and towels.<br> <br>A dull ache spread its way slowly through her as she allowed her muscles to unclench. Her whole body felt like a twisted rope unwinding.<br> <br>Already, Coach had drilled the routine at least twenty times. Even if Coach <i>had</i> wanted them to go again, Isobel didn&#x2019;t think she could have managed another pike basket toss, let alone landed one more full.<br> <br>She knew she wasn&#x2019;t the only one running on fumes either.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d felt the entire squad&#x2019;s energy draining away little by little, like a machine operating on a single dying battery.<br> <br>Coach must have felt it too. Isobel had no doubt that she would have drilled them until midnight if she hadn&#x2019;t sensed her squad preparing for mutiny.<br> <br>Then again, it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for Coach to pull this kind of boot-camp, cheer-till-you-drop drillathon, especially right before a big competition. And this was <i>the</i> competition, after all. But her motivation for killing them like this lay less, Isobel knew, in ironing out any last-minute kinks and more in sending everyone home too tired to do anything but crash.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you all to get some <i>rest</i> tonight,&#x201d; Coach shouted above a sudden burst of laughing and talking, her words confirming Isobel&#x2019;s suspicions. &#x201c;That means no late-night Facebook updates, no texting, no two a.m. phone calls with Mr. or Miss Flavor of the Week, and <i>no</i> last-minute stunting in the living room&#x2014;I&#x2019;m talking to you, Miss Dorbon. I want everybody here in one piece and ready to go at five a.m. <i>sharp.</i> Got that?&#x201d; Coach lifted one thick arm over her frizzy poof of brown hair and pointed at her wristwatch. &#x201c;Bus leaves at <i>six</i> on the dot, so set your alarms. No hitting the snooze button forty times. No &#x2018;I forgot my uniform.&#x2019; No excuses. I know I don&#x2019;t have to tell any of you that we won&#x2019;t wait if you&#x2019;re late.&#x201d;<br> <br>Speaking of late, Isobel wondered what time it was. It felt like they&#x2019;d been there for hours.<br> <br>She glanced above the gym doors to the white-faced clock secured behind the protective metal grate designed to shield it from foul balls.<br> <br>At the sight of the dark, familiar figure standing in the doorway, however, all thoughts of time flew from her mind.<br> <br>Hands stuffed into the pockets of his black jeans, he watched her from behind reflective sunglasses, his expression calm, blank.<br> <br>A panicked stirring arose inside her, coupled with a nagging sensation that tugged at the back of her mind, like a child pulling on the hem of her mother&#x2019;s dress. It was as though some deeper part of her was trying desperately to get her attention.<br> <br>Behind her, Isobel could hear Coach Anne&#x2019;s continued tirade as she rattled off reminders about their uniforms and which colored tennis shoe inserts to wear. Blue bows for hair this time, she droned, not yellow. A-line skirts, <i>not</i> pleated.<br> <br>The longer Isobel stared at the figure standing in the open doorway, though, the more distant Coach&#x2019;s voice began to grow. The walls of the gymnasium, the squad, and the floor, too&#x2014;they all blurred out of her vision until there was only him.<br> <br>Isobel walked toward the figure and reached for the glasses, the urge to strip them from his face and look into his eyes nothing short of a compulsion.<br> <br>He stopped her hand with his. The contact made her pause, and the nameless dread inside her melted away as his fingers intertwined with hers.<br> <br>His hand felt so warm.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready to go?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>His voice rippled through her, low, soft, and a little husky&#x2014;like the hushed crackling of an old-fashioned record player just before the music starts. Quieting the tangled mesh of her thoughts, it numbed her like a drug.<br> <br>Her eyes flicked down from his glasses to the slight smile that tugged at one corner of his mouth. A glint of light caught on his lip ring, causing the silver to flash.<br> <br>Suddenly it was too hard to breathe. She wanted to feel that tiny slip of metal against her own lips, to kiss him. As if that would somehow help her catch her breath.<br> <br>But she couldn&#x2019;t escape the feeling that there was something about the moment, something about his very <i>presence</i> that she wasn&#x2019;t grasping. It was as if her mind had misplaced some vital bit of information. Or lost it entirely.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2014;what are you doing here?&#x201d; she asked him, because it was the one question that kept pushing all the others out of the way.<br> <br>One of his eyebrows drifted above the top edge of his sunglasses. His half smile remained in place. &#x201c;I came to pick you up,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my girlfriend. I do that now, remember?&#x201d;<br> <br><i>Girlfriend.</i><br> <br>The word felt like a switchblade to her heart. The pain it evoked was more tender than sharp, though, the kind that comes along with saying good-bye to a friend you know you&#x2019;ll never see again.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon,&#x201d; he said before she could ask any more questions. He began to turn away and she felt his hand tighten around hers, squeezing, tugging her after him. &#x201c;We should go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel found herself following him, her steps falling in stride with his.<br> <br>She wanted to look back, to see who&#x2019;d been watching and who had noticed. Certainly Coach had seen her go. Isobel couldn&#x2019;t understand why Coach wasn&#x2019;t yelling at her right that very second, shouting for her to come back and that practice wasn&#x2019;t over until after cooldown. But she didn&#x2019;t have time to turn around. She and Varen had already reached the double doors that led out into the school&#x2019;s rear parking lot.<br> <br>They pushed through, greeted by a cascade of snow that poured from above, the gray-purple clouds all but blotting out the sky, leaving no room for the cold winter sun.<br> <br>Varen&#x2019;s black 1967 Cougar sat alone in the empty parking lot, a dark inkblot surrounded by a sea of vacant whiteness.<br> <br>Isobel frowned. Where were all the other cars? Where was the line of minivans and SUVs waiting to pick up the rest of the squad? Where was Coach&#x2019;s hulking, rust-red Suburban?<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to show you something,&#x201d; she heard Varen say, though he didn&#x2019;t turn around.<br> <br>Isobel&#x2019;s focus narrowed in on the nape of his neck, the place where his hair, black and silken, jagged as crows&#x2019; feathers, brushed the collar of his T-shirt.<br> <br>Had she only just noticed how long it had grown?<br> <br>A breeze whipped past them, and his bare arms made her wonder why he hadn&#x2019;t worn his jacket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Varen, where are we going?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; was his only response as he hurried her through the parking lot. Beneath their feet, the snow, still fresh and powdery, made no sound.<br> <br>Reaching the Cougar, he opened and held the passenger-side door for her, the cab light illuminating the familiar burgundy interior.<br> <br>She hesitated and glanced back to Varen. Shifting his weight from one foot to the other, he gestured to the upholstery. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;sorry about that. Still waiting on those mink seat covers.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel shot him a wry smile. Before she could return his trademark sarcasm with her own dry quip, though, something about his appearance made her pause.<br> <br>There was something missing. Something off . . .<br> <br>She realized that even though she was looking straight at him, she could not see herself in the mirrored lenses of his glasses, only the reflection of blackened trees standing in rows behind her, their thin prison-bar trunks still visible through the thickening screen of falling snow.<br> <br>In the reflection, a large ebony bird lifted off from one of the twisted branches, and the sound of its beating wings caused her to flinch and whirl. But when she looked, there were no trees. No bird. Only the rigid outline of Trenton High&#x2019;s neo-Gothic facade.<br> <br>From here, Isobel could just make out the four spires of the school&#x2019;s main entrance tower peeking up over the roof&#x2019;s ledge. The countless windowpanes glared white, refracting the overcast light like a thousand dead eyes. Even though she&#x2019;d just left the squad in the gym, the entire building now appeared deserted&#x2014;except for the top floor, where Isobel thought she saw the silhouette of someone standing in one of the windows, watching them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get in,&#x201d; Varen said. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel turned and sank into the car, spurred by the urgency in his voice.<br> <br>She shut the door behind her and, glancing to the driver&#x2019;s side, was shocked to find him already there, one hand on the steering wheel, the other locked around the stick shift, the bulky onyx gem of his class ring shining like oil in the stark light.<br> <br>The car hummed. Isobel felt her seat vibrate beneath her as the engine rumbled, though she couldn&#x2019;t recall his turning the key. The smell of exhaust fumes filtered into her awareness while the windshield wipers jumped into action, slashing back and forth to cast off the gathering snow. By now, the cascade of whiteness had grown so heavy that the world outside had all but vanished.<br> <br>Beside her on the seat, the ratty old Discman Varen had rigged up to the Cougar&#x2019;s dashboard radio sprang to life. Through the tiny rectangular window, Isobel saw the disc inside whir. A woman&#x2019;s soft voice erupted through a hiss of static. Her humming, unaccompanied by any instrumentals, filled the car. Soft and sweet, sad but beautiful, the naked melody was one Isobel had never heard before. The voice, too, was unfamiliar, possessing an airy quality, wispy and almost shy.<br> <br>Without warning, Varen snatched the Discman, yanking it free from the wires that connected it to the dashboard, instantly silencing the static and the humming. With a hard scowl, he tossed the CD player into the backseat. Grabbing the stick shift again, he threw the car into gear.<br> <br>His foot hit the gas pedal and they began to move, accelerating to top speed. Isobel opened her mouth to speak, but Varen cut her off, turning the wheel sharply.<br> <br>Pressed to the passenger-side door, she groped for something to hold on to, instantly reminded of that night he&#x2019;d driven her home, careening down the road while ignoring her desperate pleas for him to stop. Fear erupted inside her like a match striking. She gripped the seat beneath her, able only to see endless white through the windows.<br> <br>&#x201c;Varen! You can&#x2019;t even see where you&#x2019;re going!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Isobel felt her muscles tighten again, coiling up, tensing in preparation for the impact that would surely kill them both any second.<br> <br>&#x201c;Varen! Ple&#x2014;&#x201d; Isobel stopped, her words evaporating in her mouth as she caught sight of the small clock embedded into the dashboard.<br> <br>The hands of the clock looped opposite each other and spun lazily around and around, never stopping. She watched the needle of the speedometer tip to and fro like the pendulum of a metronome.<br> <br>The gas gauge read empty, but she could <i>hear</i> the engine growling, guzzling fuel.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she whispered, more to herself than to him. &#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t . . . This is a dr&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br><i>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t,&#x201d;</i> he snapped, silencing her. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>His foot slammed on the brake. Isobel pitched forward in her seat as the car skidded to a halt, its tires shrieking.<br> <br>Like sand being blown from a relic, the snow coating the windshield began to erode.<br> <br>Or rather, Isobel thought, the <i>ash.</i><br> <br>Tiny blots of bright crimson now fluttered down all around them, lighting on the windshield.<br> <br>The car jerked to a final stop, causing Isobel to fly back again. Frantic, she turned toward the driver&#x2019;s side, only to find the car door flung open and Varen gone.<br> <br>Outside, countless red roses bobbed their heads, their waxy leaves rustling in a sudden gust of wind that sent even more blood-colored petals raining over the car.<br> <br>Thick and heady, the aroma of the blossoms weighed down the air.<br> <br>Isobel fumbled for the handle on her door, which popped open as soon as she touched the latch. Jerking her arm with it, the door swung out wide over the jagged edge of a black cliff.<br> <br>Far below, milky waters churned amid toothy rocks while the waves clamored one over the other, snapping like white wolves before smashing against the flat face of the cliff.<br> <br>Isobel gave a silent shriek. She backpedaled for the driver&#x2019;s side. Twisting, she grabbed hold of the steering wheel, using it to pull herself out on the other side.<br> <br>She spilled hard onto the ground. Rolling onto her back, she hiked one knee up and kicked, sending the door of the Cougar slamming shut.<br> <br>The echoing clap caused the car to disperse into ashes.<br> <br>Isobel raised her arms to shield her face from the spray of grit. Through the settling dust, she saw that the cliffs had vanished, leaving only the surrounding walls of ruby blossoms.<br> <br>In the midst of what appeared to be an enormous rose garden, a familiar structure became discernible through the screen of the settling powder.<br> <br>Isobel recognized the structure as the fountain from Varen&#x2019;s neighborhood. It now stood in the center of a circular dome-shaped room enclosed by scarlet blooms.<br> <br>Without the curtain of crystal water pouring from the ledge of its rounded green basin, the fountain was a silent and eerie monument.<br> <br>Isobel pulled herself to her feet, her practice sneakers caked with ash, chalk white against a carpet of ruby petals.<br> <br>Her eyes locked on the statue of the woman that stood at the top of the fountain, her stiff stone veil clutched in her hands, the fabric arcing out behind her nearly nude figure in a backward C.<br> <br>Isobel turned in a circle. All around her, buds and blossoms in various states of unfurling dotted the trellised walls. High over the statue&#x2019;s head, thick vines met at a circular opening at the top of the domed ceiling. Through the porthole, she could see a tangled webwork of black tree limbs.<br> <br>What was this place?<br> <br>And where was&#x2014;?<br> <br>&#x201c;Varen!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel started, nearly yelping as she found him standing right in front of her.<br> <br>She peered up into eyes no longer shielded by sunglasses. Their centers were black, swept clean of color and light.<br> <br>She searched through their darkness, desperate to find some irrefutable evidence in their depths that could prove it was really him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is&#x2014;is any of this real?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Are <i>you</i> real?&#x201d;<br> <br>He lifted a hand to her cheek, his fingers brushing her jaw.<br> <br>&#x201c;Even if this is a dream,&#x201d; he whispered, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br> <br>Isobel&#x2019;s eyes widened, recognizing those words as her own, the same ones she had once uttered to him. She reached for him, her arms twining around his neck, drawing him to her so that his scent poured over her, that combination of incense, citrus, and dried leaves overriding the funeral smell of the crowding flowers.<br> <br>He lowered his forehead to hers, his hair draping around their faces, the smooth strands tickling her skin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave,&#x201d; she breathed.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; he whispered. &#x201c;Right here. Waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>He leaned in.<br> <br>Isobel tilted her chin up, ready for the press of his lips.<br> <br>She wanted to let her eyes fall shut, but something, a sensation of being watched, stopped her. Her glance slid past his shoulder, her focus drawn to the statue atop the fountain.<br> <br>Between the inky strands of Varen&#x2019;s hair, Isobel watched its eyes slide open. She stared, transfixed, as the statue turned its head toward them, aiming those two empty pits of blackness straight at her.</p><h2>The Cyclist Who Went Out in the Cold: Adventures Along the Iron Curtain Trail</h2><p><b>A hideously over-ambitions challenge on doomed machinery: Tim Moore, author of <i>Gironimo!</i>, cycles the length of the old Iron Curtain.</b> <br><br>Scaling a new peak of rash over-ambition, Tim Moore tackles the 9,000km route of the old Iron Curtain on a tiny-wheeled, two-geared East German shopping bike. <br><br>Asking for trouble and getting it, he sets off from the northernmost Norwegian-Russian border at the Arctic winter's brutal height, bullying his plucky MIFA 900 through the endless and massively sub-zero desolation of snowbound Finland. <br><br>Sleeping in bank vaults, imperial palaces and unreconstructed Soviet youth hostels, battling vodka-breathed Russian hostility, Romanian landslides and a diet of dumplings, Moore and his 'so-small bicycle' are sustained by the kindness of reindeer farmers and Serbian rock gods, plus a shameful addiction to Magic Man energy drink. <br><br>Haunted throughout by the border detritus of watchtowers and rusted razor wire, Moore reflects on the curdling of the Communist dream, and the memories of a Cold War generation reared on the fear of apocalypse -- at a time of ratcheting East-West tension. <br><br>After three months, 20 countries and a 58-degree jaunt up the centigrade scale, man and bike finally wobble up to a Black Sea beach in Bulgaria, older and wiser, but mainly older.</p><p>TIM MOORE's writing has appeared in the <i>Daily Telegraph, the Observer, The Sunday Times</i> and <i>Esquire</i>.

The family--descendeds from Mohammed--owns homes and horse stables all over the world, and sits as the spiritual head of a sect of 15 million Muslims. Anne Edwards tells the Aga Khans story by focusing on three generations--the current Aga Khan, his father and his grandfather. These are men who lives are those of fairy tales. They live in lavish surroundings, are notorious in their pursuit of women and throw outrageous parties. Ripe material for a biography, and Edwards delivers it well.For engrossing gossip about the really rich and famous, here's the scoop on the third-richest man in the world, the late Aga Khan III, descendant of Muhammad and spiritual leader of the Muslim Ismailis from the reign of Victoria to beyond WWII. His fabled wealth derived not from the pursuits of ordinary robber barons but from the generous tributes of his millions of followers. Twice in his lifetime, in a legendary ceremony, they matched his hefty weight with gold. Although he committed much of his wealth to bettering their lives through education, housing and health care, enough remained to support his own fabulous lifestyle, which included wives, mistresses, offspring and champion horses. Sincerely devout, he spent an hour every day in meditation and study of the Koran. He despaired of his playboy son Aly Khan, husband of Rita Hayworth, and he never married or divorced without observing Muslim precepts. A devoted Anglophile, he used his influence to keep the British in India as long as he could. Edwards (Sonya: The Life of Countess Tolstoy) sets this account against the great world events in which his wealth and influence played significant parts.

Boreham&#39;s pilgrimage to the birthplaces and homes of many great English and Scottish writers and his communion with them as the young writer recalls quotations and thoughts from their books. His pen romps over the pages as he writes about the topics which would become some of his lifelong themes history, literature, faith, heroism, royalty and the charms in everyday life. Boreham&#39;s ability to paint a picture, tell a story and uncover fascinating detail is evident on every page (Dr. Geoff Pound). This book has been out of print for over 100 years. For the first time it has a proper cover (it was a stapled gray booklet) and a contents page. With the exception of a few minor alterations, the original language including the British spelling is intact. An About the Cover section is included in the back.</p><p>BOREHAM, FRANK WILLIAM (1871-1959), preacher and writer, was born on March 3, 1871 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, eldest child of Francis Boreham, solicitor&#39;s clerk, and his wife Fanny Usher. He was educated and was later a pupil-teacher at Grosvenor United School, Tunbridge Wells. In December 1884 he became junior clerk with a local brickworks where, in a locomotive accident, he lost his right foot, necessitating the life-long use of a stick. Late in 1887 he went to work as a clerk in London, becoming increasingly involved in church, debating and writing activities. Although his family was Anglican, he was baptized at Stockwell Old Baptist Church in 1890; he preached from pavement and pulpit and published Won to Glory in 1891. He was admitted to Spurgeon&#39;s College, London, in August 1892, serving as a student-minister at Theydon Bois, Essex, where he met Estella Maud Mary Cottee. In 1894 Boreham was called to the Scottish community at Mosgiel near Dunedin in New Zealand, and was inducted on March 17, 1895. Stella, then 18, followed to marry him at Kaiapoi on April 13, 1896. Boreham became president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand in 1902, and published The Whisper of God and Other Sermons. He wrote editorials for the Otago Daily Times, contributed to theological journals and, as a keen temperance advocate, participated in liquor polls in 1905 and 1907. In June 1906 Boreham was called to the Baptist Tabernacle, Hobart. He edited the Southern Baptist and later the weekly Australian Baptist and in 1910 became president of the Tasmanian Baptist Union. His George Augustus Selwyn was published in 1911. He wrote a biographical series for the Hobart Mercury, which in 40 years covered 2000 persons; in 1912-59 he contributed 2500 editorials to the Mercury and the Melbourne Age. Boreham&#39;s 80 publications, including religious works, homiletic essays and novels, sold over one million copies.Loose Leaves is different from his regular genre of writing, yet this is very much an F. W. Boreham book. If memory serves me right, I believe this was the first of two trips that he made home during all of his years down below, and this journal is full of the youthful excitement that he felt when leaving home for New Zealand. No, there are no sermons on these pages (well, the story of Cromwell, which I&#39;ve copied down for myself, is a very good sermon on making friends out of enemies), yet even without the usual dose of religious sermonizing, this book is full of Boreham&#39;s taking the ordinary things of daily living and turning them into a most interesting travelogue. To me it&#39;s a bit similar to his autobiography, My Pilgrimage, and the stories he shares there. I read that book over ten years ago, and I&#39;ve never forgotten his tale of getting out of the car, walking over to a large constrictor type of snake and trying to make it move. He succeeded, and by the time he got the car door closed, that snake had its head on the running-board! In Loose Leaves you&#39;ll find many other personal, historical and fun stories. I found myself drawn onto the deck of the Tongariro, and was caught-up into the sights and sounds of daily ship life. I found myself wishing that I could have been in one of those Sunday services when Dr. Boreham gave a sermon, but I must content myself with reading one. The detail he wove into these Loose Leaves is astounding. Who would have thought that standing on the deck of a boat watching a group of men load coal into the ship could be turned into an interesting story, but that&#39;s exactly what he did. If you don&#39;t believe me, you&#39;ll have to read it for yourself. Then the anticipation builds as we draw nigh to the homeland of England and Scotland. I felt myself standing beside him, straining my eyes, and looking for that first glimpse of home. Then you feel the excitement leaping off the pages as you read of his enjoyment being home again after many years. Oh, the history that he shares with us as he revisits those places of his childhood. (Do you know why horseshoes are considered lucky? Read Loose Leaves and you&#39;ll discover the answer!) I&#39;m a history buff, and as I read I actually realized I was getting two doses of history: the ancient history that he shares with us, and the things that were modern to him in 1903 are now glimpses of history to me as well. There is no getting bored with Boreham, and even when writing travel notes, he takes the hum-drum of life and makes it rich reading that captures your attention. For my fellow Boreham book-lovers make sure you add this title to your collection. No, it&#39;s not a first edition, but until you discover one of the original undiscovered copies, you can enjoy everything it contains and enjoy making your own journey through a new Boreham-land! Believe me, it&#39;s a trip you&#39;ll immensely enjoy! --Bryan Gish</p><h2>Kama Sutra</h2><p>An expert on sex and relationships and author of Supersex offers her personal take on the ancient sexual wisdom of the Kama Sutra in an illustrated collection of more than one hundred different sexual positions, organized into such sections as Erotic, Emotional, Exotic, Expert, and Exhibitionist.

Because of this deeply held belief, chicken is served at every New Year celebration, every wedding feast, and every birthday dinner. The chicken is honored for its eggs, its meat, and the flavor it provides for stocks and broths. Because of the reverence for this bird, the Chinese prepare chicken in myriad ways. Chicken is steamed, baked, boiled, stir-fried, deep-fried, pan-fried, and roasted. It is served hot, cold, or at room temperature. No part of the chicken is wasted from its bones to its skin to its feet, a Chinese delicacy. <br> Now, renowned Chinese cooking expert Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, who has been called "the Marcella Hazan of Chinese cooking" by <i>The New York Times,</i> brings her love of Chinese cooking and traditional Chinese chicken recipes to American home cooks in <i>The Chinese Chicken Cookbook.</i> <br> <i>The Chinese Chicken Cookbook</i> brings together more than one hundred of the best traditional and modern chicken recipes of China from simple stir-fries to more elaborate celebration dishes.

Recipes such as Two-Sesame Chicken, Hot and Sour Soup, Ginger Noodles with Chicken, Chicken Water Dumplings, Chicken Stir-Fried with Broccoli, Mu Shu Chicken with Bok Bang, Mah-Jongg Chicken, and Asparagus Wrapped in Minced Chicken offer new and flavorful ways to prepare chicken whether you're making a quick weeknight meal or having dinner guests on a Saturday night. <br> Although these recipes use ingredients that home chefs can find in the international section of a well-stocked supermarket or on the Internet, Lo includes the Chinese names for ingredients and recipes, rendered in beautiful Chinese calligraphic characters. Not only decorative, these characters can help you locate unfamiliar ingredients in a Chinese market. <i>The Chinese Chicken Cookbook</i> also has sections on how to select and clean a chicken, a detailed explanation of Chinese ingredients, suggested equipment (including how to properly season a wok), and how to cook a perfect pot of rice. <br> With wonderful family stories from the author's childhood in China, <i>The Chinese Chicken Cookbook</i> is not just a cookbook for your cookbook library, it is a source of culinary inspiration.</p><p><b>Eileen Yin-Fei Lo,</b> renowned cooking teacher, chef, and Chinese cooking authority, has been called the "Cantonese Julia Child" as well as the "Marcella Hazan of Chinese cooking."

A council is called to determine who the angel is and why he&#x2019;s fallen, and everyone may tell a tale as evidence. One by one the fae-folk give their stories to judge the nature of the mysterious angel. The multiauthor, round-robin style of storytelling is common among fantasy/fairy stories, and this book handles the framework well. The stories are both fun and distinctive, with standouts such as Louise Hawes&#x2019; take on the Adam and Eve story (&#x201c;Original Sin&#x201d;) and Alisa Kwitney&#x2019;s folktale about the acceptance of one&#x2019;s own mortality (&#x201c;Chaya Surah and the Angel of Death&#x201d;). The most stunning element of the book, though, is Guay&#x2019;s artwork, which moves from style to style to fit each tale. The rich, textured linework and muted, monochromatic color palette give off a great sense of warmth and depth. In all, a beautiful book. --Tina Coleman</p><h2>Grouse &amp; Woodcock: A Gunner's Guide</h2><p>Grouse and Woodcock: A Gunner&#39;s Guide [Paperback] Don Johnson (Author)</p><p></p><h2>Going My Own Way</h2><p>Bing Crosby&#39;s eldest son discusses the problems of growing up in the family of a celebrity, his relationship with his father, his battle with drugs and alcoholism, and his own career</p><p></p><h2>Royal Manuscripts: The Genius of Illumination</h2><p>Illuminated manuscripts collected by the kings and queens of England from the 9th to the 16th century form the heart of a unique and visually stunning collection held by the British Library.

In the Iroquois tradition of upstate New York, corn, beans, and squash&#x2014;known as the "three sisters"&#x2014;were the staple source of food. Grown together, the beans wound their vines around the sturdy corn stalks and the squash leaves shaded the ground, keeping it cool, moist, and free of weeds.<br><br>At Cornell University, the department of crop and soil sciences has been cultivating a demonstration garden of corn, beans, and squash to illustrate the caloric and protein advantage of the "three sisters" compared to crops of corn, beans, or squash alone. This garden is open to schools and visitors curious to learn about indigenous cropping systems.<br><br><b>Serves 8</b><br>Total time: about 1 hour<br><br><b>5 to 6 cups butternut squash (bite-sized chunks)<br>2 cups coarsely chopped red onions<br>2 tablespoons minced or pressed garlic<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>3 tablespoons olive or other vegetable oil<br>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves<br>2 teaspoons dried thyme (2 tablespoons fresh) <br>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels<br>1 1/2 cups frozen lima beans*<br>1/4 cup minced fresh parsley (optional)<br><br>*canned lima beans, rinsed and drained, are also fine.<br><br></b>Preheat the oven to 450�.<br><br>In a large bowl, combine the squash, red onions, garlic, and salt.

As emergency workers desperately scramble to rescue the victims from the charred wreckage, their souls begin an incredible journey through one fantastic nightmare world after another.

Maggie lives in a small town in southern central New York. Find her at www.maggieshayne.com.<i>April Fools' Day, 2000</i><p>Maya had always been of two minds about working at the saloon. Of course, it wasn't a five-star restaurant, or even a respectable club. It was where the ordinary folk liked to come to unwind. You would never see the church ladies or the PTA moms on the leather bar stools munching pretzels and sipping beer at the OK Corral. But they didn't have to see Maya waiting tables to know she worked there. It was a small town.</p><p>Everyone in Big Falls knew she was a barmaid.</p><p>And itprobably didn't do her efforts at becoming respectable much good at all. But the thing was, this was the family business. It put food on the table. And it was an honest business, and one her mother had worked hard to make successful. It meant a lot to Vidalia Brand. And respectability or no, family came first with Maya. Always had. That was the way she'd been raised.</p><p>So she helped out at the OK Corral, just as her sisters did.</p><p>Well, all except for Edie. Edie was off in L.A. chasing her own dreams. And respectability didn't seem to be too high on her list.</p><p>Anyway, April Fools' night started out like any other Saturday night at the Corral. Kara helped in the kitchen, where her frequent accidents were heard but not seen. Selene waited tables, so long as no meat dishes were ordered. Mel tended bar and served as unofficial bouncer. And Maya did most of the cooking, and gave line dancing lessons, as she did every Tuesday and Saturday.</p><p>In fact, the only thing that truly set this particular Saturday night apart from any other was that it was Maya's last Saturday as a twenty-eight-year-old woman. On Sunday, she would turn twenty-nine. And twenty-nine was only twelve months away from thirty. And she was still single, still alone. Still an outcast struggling to make herself acceptable. Still living with her mother and working at the Corral. Still... everything she didn't want to be. Still a virgin.</p><p>So she was depressed and moody, and she'd sneaked a couple of beers tonight, which was totally unlike her. As a result, she was just the slightest bit off the bubble, as her mother would have put it, as she walked out of the kitchen. Wiping her hands on her apron, she strained her eyes to adjust to the dimmer light in the bar. Dark hardwood walls and floor, gleaming mahogany bar, sound system turned down low for the moment. Just enough to create a soothing twang underlying the constant clink of ice and glasses, the thud of frosted mugs on the bar, and the low murmur of working men in conversation. The light fixtures were small wagon wheels suspended over every table, a bigger one way up in the rafters dead center. Dimmer switches were essential, of course. The only time the lights got turned up to high beam was when they closed the doors to clean up. The row of ceiling fans over the bar whirred softly and tousled her hair when she walked underneath them.</p><p>And then she looked up.</p><p>And <i>he </i>was there.</p><p>He'd just come through the batwing doors from the street outside. He stopped just inside them, and he looked around as if it were his first time at the Corral. And as Maya looked him over, she thought he seemed just about as depressed and moody as she was.</p><p>"Now that looks like a cowboy who's been rode hard and put away wet one too many times," Vidalia said near her ear.</p><p>Maya started. She hadn't even heard her mother come up beside her. And though she tried to send her a disapproving glance for her choice of words, she found it tough to take her eyes off the man. "Who is he?" she asked. "I don't recognize him."</p><p>Vidalia shrugged. "I don't, either."</p><p>He wasn't tall, but he wasn't short, either. Not reed thin or overweight or bursting with muscle. Just an average build. He had dark hair under a battered brown cowboy hat that bore no brand name or markings she could detect. His jeans were faded. His denim shirt unsnapped, untucked and hanging open over a black T-shirt with a single pocket. Even his boots were scuffed and dusty. But none of that was what made her so unable to look away. It was something about his face. His eyes, scanning the bar as if he were looking for something, someone... there was a quiet sorrow about those eyes. A loneliness. A lost look about the man... and it touched off that nurturing instinct of hers from the moment she saw it.</p><p>She walked closer without even knowing she was doing it, and those lonely eyes fell on her. Blue. They were deep blue. So blue she could see that vivid color even in this low lighting. His lips curved up in a fake smile of greeting, and she forced hers to do the same. But the smile didn't reach his eyes. They still looked as sad as the eyes of a motherless pup as they latched on to hers as if she were his last hope.</p><p>"Can I help you with something?" she asked him at last.</p><p>He shrugged. "Can I get a beer?" he asked.</p><p>"Well now, this <i>is </i>a saloon." She took his arm for some reason. Kind of the way a mother would take hold of a lost child to lead him home. "Mister, your shirt's wet through."</p><p>"That's because it's raining outside."</p><p>"Yes, but when it's raining outside, most people stay inside." She took him to a table near the fireplace. It was in the area where the line dancing lessons would be starting up in a short while, but the man was chilled to the bone. He had to be.</p><p>He took the seat she showed him and looked at her sheepishly. "I had a flat on my pickup. Had to change the tire in the rain."</p><p>"I'd have let it sit there until it let up."</p><p>"I hear it hasn't let up in days."</p><p>"I suppose you have a point." She signaled Selene, who came right over. "Hot cocoa. Bring a whole pot."</p><p>"Um, I asked for a beer."</p><p>"Beer will only make you colder. You want to catch your death?"</p><p>He blinked up at her, then shrugged in surrender.</p><p>"And see if you can find a dry shirt kicking around, will you, Selene?" Maya added.</p><p>Selene nodded, tilting her head as she examined the stranger. Of them all, she was the most strikingly different. A throwback to their father's family, Maya supposed. Her hair was long, lustrous, perfectly straight and silvery blond. Her eyes were palest blue, so they, too, often seemed silver. They seemed silver now, as she narrowed them on the man.</p><p>"You new in town?" Selene asked him.</p><p>"Just passing through," he told her.</p><p>Selene's gaze slid from his face, to her sister's. "That's odd. I got the feeling you were here to stay." She shrugged, tipping her head sideways, and said, "Oh, well," as she turned to hurry away.</p><p>The stranger sent Maya a questioning glance.</p><p>"This month she's convinced she has ESP," she explained. "Last month she was exploring her past lives in Atlantis."</p><p>He grinned widely. "Your sister?" he asked.</p><p>"How'd you guess?"</p><p>"There's a resemblance."</p><p>Maya smiled back at him, feeling warm all over just from the light in his eyes. "I'll take that as a compliment."</p><p>"You were meant to."</p><p>There was something in his eyes that made her heart quiver. She cleared her throat, searched for something to say, and came up with the lamest line in any bar in any town ever. "So, where are you from?"</p><p>His smile died. All at once, just like that. He lowered his eyes. Cleared his throat. "Umm...a long ways from here. You wouldn't know it."</p><p>"Try me." She wasn't sure why she said it. Curiosity, she supposed. She wanted to know his story. What had hurt him. What had sent him out into the dark rainy night, to a strange town, a strange bar, a strange woman...</p><p>He looked up again. Seemed about to say something. Then seemed to change his mind. "Tulsa. I'm from Tulsa."</p><p>"Well, now, Tulsa's not far away. And I'm pretty sure everyone in this room has heard of it." She smiled gently at the way his eyes widened, and he looked around. "Hey, don't look so nervous. I'm not gonna tell anyone where you're from if you don't want me to."</p><p>His gaze met hers again. Burned into hers. "I appreciate that."</p><p>"Are you in some kind of trouble?" she asked.</p><p>He shook his head slowly. "I'm not wanted or anything, if that's what you mean."</p><p>The reply that popped into her head was that he most certainly <i>was </i>wanted. Right now. By her. But she bit her tongue and didn't speak. The fire snapped, and its scent made her nostrils burn. The glow from the flames painted his face in light and shadow, and she took advantage of the chance to explore it more thoroughly. He had a straight nose that began high and was on the large side. It made her think of royalty, that nose. His jawline was sharply delineated, and he hadn't shaved in several hours. A soft dusting of dark whiskers coated his cheeks and his chin. Reaching up, she took off his hat, again moving without thinking first. It was unlike her to be this forward with anyone. But she took the hat off, and it was wet. His hair underneath, though, was dry. Brown and fire-glow red in places, when the firelight hit it. It was thick, wavy, but short. If it grew long, she thought, it would look crimp-curled. But short it couldn't. He kept it that way to keep it tame, she mused. He liked control.</p><p>And now who was pretending to have ESP?</p><p>"Stealin' my hat, ma'am?" he asked, his voice very soft, very deep, and stroking her nerve endings like callused fingers on velvet.</p><p>"Umm... it's wet." Turning away to hide the rush of heat to her face, she hung the hat on one of the pegs beside the fireplace. Then she spoke to him over her shoulder, avoiding his eyes. "Might as well hang that shirt up here, too," she told him.</p><p>His reply came from close beside her. "If you say so." A second later, his damp denim brushed her arm as he leaned in close to her to hang it up beside his hat. His shoulder was pressed to hers, his hip...and he looked down slowly, and his mouth was only inches from hers as he turned toward her....</p><p>"Ahem!"</p><p>Maya jumped, and the stranger spun.</p><p>"Your cocoa is here," Selene said, her mysterious silver eyes sliding from one of them to the other. She put the pot on the table, set a cup beside it, and tossed a Denver Broncos sweatshirt over the back of the chair. "It belongs to a friend of mine, so make sure I get it back."</p><p>"Thanks," the man said. He took the sweatshirt and pulled it on over his T-shirt, arms...</p></p><h2>Lists of Swiss Emigrants in the Eighteenth Century to the American Colonies 2</h2><p>This is the authoritative work on Swiss emigration to the Carolinas and Pennsylvania in the 18th century.

Beginning with Operation COBRA and ending with the offensive which led to the liberation of Paris, this critical phase of the war in the west is examined and described by senior German officers. These, from staff officers at OKW to divisional generals on the ground, critique their performance, examine Allied superiority, and evaluate their own efforts to contain Allied forces in Normandy. They look at such key events as the counter-attack at Mortain, the American offensive, British and Canadian efforts and the sequence of events that led to the fighting around the Falaise gap. The German officers originally submitted the reports presented here to Allied intelligence efforts as part of post-war debriefing sessions. The current volume, which follows on from Fighting the Invasion and Fighting in Normandy, consists of carefully selected and edited material. Fighting the Breakout gives a broad picture of German hopes balanced with the realisation that they could not hope to contain the Allied efforts for long. With supplementary material by David C. Isby, Fighting the Breakout is a fascinating glimpse into how a defeated army sought hard to turn the tide of defeat.</p><p>David C. Isby is a military historian of renown.

So why not take charge of your marketing campaign and make it what you want it to be and not some big accident (or one waiting to happen)? Let's start off with a little image consulting.

The Occupy movement made the plight of the 99 percent an indelible part of the public consciousness, and concerns about inequality were a decisive factor in the 2012 presidential elections.<br> <br>How bad is it? According to Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist David Cay Johnston, most Americans, in inflation&#x2013;adjusted terms, are now back to the average income of 1966. Shockingly, from 2009 to 2011, the top 1 percent got 121 percent of the income gains while the bottom 99 percent saw their income fall. Yet in this most unequal of developed nations, every aspect of inequality remains hotly contested and poorly understood.<br> <br> <i>Divided</i> collects the writings of leading scholars, activists, and journalists to provide an illuminating, multifaceted look at inequality in America, exploring its devastating implications in areas as diverse as education, justice, health care, social mobility, and political representation.

By the author of Jane Fairfax.</p><p>Joan Aiken was born in Sussex in 1924. She was the daughter of the American poet, Conrad Aiken; her sister, Jane Aiken Hodge, is also a novelist. Before joining the &#39;family business&#39; herself, Joan had a variety of jobs, including working for the BBC, the United Nations Information Centre and then as features editor for a short story magazine. Her first children&#39;s novel, The Kingdom of the Cave, was published in 1960. Joan Aiken wrote over a hundred books for young readers and adults and is recognized as one of the classic authors of the twentieth century. Amanda Craig, writing in The Times, said, &#39;She was a consummate story-teller, one that each generation discovers anew.&#39; Her best-known books are those in the James III saga, of which The Wolves of Willoughby Chase was the first title, published in l962 and awarded the Lewis Carroll prize. Both that and Black Hearts in Battersea have been filmed. Her books are internationally acclaimed and she received the Edgar Allan Poe Award in the United States as well as the Guardian Award for Fiction in this country for The Whispering Mountain. Joan Aiken was decorated with an MBE for her services to children&#39;s books. She died in 2004.Prolific, innovative storyteller Aiken (Jane Fairfax, 1991, etc.) again pays tribute to Jane Austen in a cheerful spinoff of Sense and Sensibility. Here Aiken pulls onstage the child Eliza, a by-blow borne by another Eliza who was, in turn, the illegitimate offspring of a cousin and old love of Colonel Brandon. It was the stalwart colonel, remember, who eventually won the hand of Marianne Dashwood, one of the two sisters around whom the Austen novel revolves. As Austen reported, in his brief confession to sensible Elinor Dashwood, the colonel mentions his deceased cousin Eliza's girl and her situation: ``I removed her and her child to the country and there she remains.'' Indeed she doesn't, in Aiken's tale, although her daughter stays in the country at an unhealthy baby farm haphazardly run by the boozing Mrs. Wellcome. Eliza III's childhood includes education of sorts from a shady clergyman, joy in trotting after Mr. Bill (Wordsworth) and Mr. Sam (Coleridge), and the pleasure of outwitting Mrs. Wellcome to rescue a tot from Gypsies. At 13, Eliza sets out to find her parents. Her search leads her to the Ferrars (Edward, now cranky and a prig; Elinor, ne&#x201a; Dashwood, now ``haggard and anxious''), to school in Bath, and to lodging with a rough-hearted widow who is also at times a buccaneer shoplifter. Eliza escapes rape, rescues Elinor from death, finds haven with an impotent duke, and discovers her parents in Portugal, where she kills a man and makes new acquaintances. What happened to Colonel Brandon, Marianne, and the faithless Willoughby, Marianne's first love? Never fear: Aiken draws all the threads together in an imaginative resolution that feels true to the spirit of Austen's novel. An engaging, calamity-filled romance rich with Aiken's shrewd reading of Austen's people and an appreciative sense of fun. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Jerome strove to assimilate Origen s hermeneutical perspective and make it his own, translating several of Origen s works into Latin. The Homilies on Ezekiel were among the most important of St. Jerome s translations.<br><br>In these homilies Origen endeavors to show his audience in the church of Caesarea how the text of Ezekiel points to and prefigures Jesus Christ and the church. Following in the footsteps of St. Paul (Rom 15.4: For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction... ) and Hebrews (10.1: For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come... ), Origen looks for the reality of Christ symbolized in the shadowy words of the prophet Ezekiel. The result is a deeply moving, reverent, and edifying exposition of the Old Testament prophet in a manner that doubtless would have been received with pleasure by St. Paul himself.<br><br>The homilies are of intrinsic interest on important Christian themes such as persecution and martyrdom, purification, justification, progress, Church unity, God s passionate love for humanity, Catholic versus heretical doctrine, and freedom of the will. The present volume offers the first published English translation of the fourteen homilies, along with Jerome s preface.</p><p><p>"A significant contribution to studies of Origen and the history of Pauline exegesis. . . . The work provides an excellent introduction to Origen's theology, presenting a wide range of themes which are central for him in his doctrine of God, anthropology, mystical theology, and eschatology. . . . Scheck's introduction provides an excellent outline of the textual issues surrounding the Latin version of the Commentary. . . . [An] admirable translation. . . . [It] provides an invaluable service in making available a text which adds much to our understanding of Origen both as a Christian exegete and as a theologian."--Maureen Beyer Moser, <i>Journal of Early Christian Studies</i> </p><p>"The Commentary contains material of interest to many kinds of scholars. Feminists will be delighted to find statements that women were reckoned among the clergy. Ethicists and moral theologians will find a wealth of explanations and particularizations of the Christian virtues mentioned in Romans 12 and 13. Protestants interested in the Calvinist doctrines of unconditional election, irresistible grace and perseverance of the saints, should look at Origen's thoughts on these beliefs. Other readers will want to take in Origen's discussion and study of the several meanings of `law' and `spirit' in Paul and the Old Testament, while others may wish to examine his harmonizing of gospel and law. Also of interest are Origen's definitions of many words in Scripture and explanations of the differences between them. . . . Mr. Scheck's erudition makes him a worthy translator. The footnotes reveal his impressive intensive and extensive grasp of the Bible (including the Septuagint and the Old Latin Version), his thorough knowledge of the correspondence between the Greek and Latin meanings of several words and phrases, and his great acquaintance with other writings of Origen and of other early church fathers. . . . "--<i>Churchman</i> </p><p>"Scheck has done the republic of letters a great service in producing this first published English translation of Origen's seminal commentary. . . . Scheck's introduction is excellent. It is based on an impressive array of Origen scholarship from the past century to the present."--Alan Reese, <i>Erasmus of Rotterdam Society Yearbook Twenty-Three</i> </p><p>"Origen's Commentary on Romans is a work that deserves careful reading and Scheck's translation makes this much easier for English speakers."--Ronald E.

The fact that she was back at their quarters was not unusual; she had just gone off shift. It was the quiet part that caught Morgan's attention. Customarily, when Robin came off duty, she would tend to burble to her mother excitedly about everything that had gone on that day, whether big or small, important or not-so-important. So, the silence that marked Robin's return this particular evening was more than enough to snag Morgan's attention. </p><p> "What's wrong?" she asked, in the tone of voice that mothers had been using in interacting with their daughters for centuries without count. </p><p> To which Robin gave the customary response in such situations, "Nothing." </p><p> Morgan considered that rather useless reply for a moment and then decided to take another angle. At that time, Morgan was engaged in studying some recent research published on the subject of wormholes, so rather than press the issue overtly by turning away from her work, she continued to scan the information on the computer screen while chatting with Robin in a fairly offhand manner. "That's nice. So...how was your day?" </p><p> "It was fine." </p><p> "And your meeting with Si Cwan?" </p><p> That clearly surprised Robin. She looked up at her mother, her eyebrows knit together in confusion. "How did you know I had a meeting with Si Cwan today?" </p><p> "I didn't. It was just an educated guess. Whenever you work with him on something lately, you come back here just a little more thoughtful than usual. Tonight you seem extremely thoughtful, so I reasoned that you had an extremely important meeting." </p><p> "Oh, well...no. No, I mean, it wasn't all that important. Just planning a diplomatic mission, that's all." </p><p> "Really. Where to?" </p><p> "It doesn't matter," Robin said. She slapped her thighs briskly and rose to her feet, clearly ready to change the subject. "So...how was your day?" </p><p> "Well...since you asked, this article on worm -- " </p><p> "Here's the thing," Robin said, crossing the room quickly and leaning on the edge of the desk. "Lately, Si Cwan seems to be keeping me at a distance." </p><p> "I see. At a distance you say." </p><p> "Yes, that's right." </p><p> "Lately." </p><p> "Yes." </p><p> "And what about not lately? That is to say, how has he been towards you in previous weeks. Or months." </p><p> "Oh, he's been polite. Respectful. Attentive to my opinions." </p><p> "And how has that changed? Recently, I mean." </p><p> "He..." Her voice trailed off as if she were losing steam. She frowned, apparently trying to consider a reply that sounded reasonable, and she couldn't quite come up with one. "Okay, maybe that hasn't changed." </p><p> "Then what are you complaining about? Oh. Of course," she said with a smile. "You're complaining because it hasn't changed. There's something going on between you and our esteemed Thallonian nobleman, isn't there? Or at least, you'd like there to be." </p><p> "The latter. Much more the latter," admitted Robin. </p><p> "Honesty with your mother. I'm impressed. There was a time not so long ago when such a thing would have been unthinkable." </p><p> "Oh, don't be silly, Mother." </p><p> "I'm not being silly. You have a tendency to draw inwards at crucial emotional times, Robin." She turned the computer screen completely away from her now and focused her full attention on her daughter. "You do a superb job putting forward the attitude and behavior of a very social animal, but you also have a real tendency to withdraw into your...your 'den,' as it were. Particularly when something that makes you uncomfortable is being presented to you." </p><p> "That's absurd, Mother. I don't withdraw anywhere. Excuse me." </p><p> "Where are you going?" </p><p> "To the bathroom." </p><p> "We're in the middle of a discussion, Robin." </p><p> "No, we're not. You're in the middle of treating me as if I'm a child, telling me that I run away and withdraw. Me, I'm just going to take a very quick shower and attend to other calls of nature." </p><p> "You're withdrawing." </p><p> "And you're ridiculous. I'll be out in ten minutes and we'll continue right where we left off, if you insist." </p><p> She went into the bathroom and emerged some time later, clad in off-duty attire. "There. How long did that take me? Ten minutes, like I said? Fifteen?" </p><p> "An hour and nineteen," said Morgan. </p><p> "No, it didn't. That's" -- then she looked at the chronometer and saw that, sure enough, an hour and nineteen minutes had passed -- <i>"absurd."</i> The word rolled unconvincingly off her tongue. </p><p> "So let's see," Morgan said coolly, engrossed once more in her work and this time not even bothering to look in her daughter's direction. "Let's see if I've got this figured out. Si Cwan is about to embark on some diplomatic mission. The truth is, you'd like to accompany him. It doesn't matter to you overmuch if you're actually <i>needed</i> on the mission, but you want to go anyway. It's a desire not particularly spawned from any mission imperative, but instead because you'd really like to have the opportunity to spend some time with him away from the ship. You figure that, if he suggested you accompany him, it might be an indicator that he shares some of the still-nebulous feelings you have for him. But he doesn't suggest it, indicating to you that he sees you only in terms of your function as his shipboard liaison rather than as someone he'd actually like to spend time with. This leaves you lost in thought as you try to determine whether you're being unprofessional, or unreasonable, or just simply too much the coward to tell Cwan exactly how it is that you do feel; presuming you've worked out your own emotions on the matter sufficiently to be able to articulate them. There. Does that more-or-less summarize the situation as it now stands?" </p><p> Robin slowly nodded and then, as if catching herself, she quickly shook her head. "No, that's not it at all...that's...the truth is, I...you see..." </p><p> "Robin," and Morgan reached over and took her hand gently. "Robin, I bear some degree of responsibility over this. If I had been there for you when you were a teenager, and you were first dealing with these kinds of heartbreaks and difficulties, I could have guided you, helped you through. Instead, you seem a bit adrift." </p><p> "Oh, Mother," and Robin patted her shoulder. "It's not really your fault." </p><p> "I know. I just thought saying that would make you feel better." </p><p> Robin rolled her eyes. Then she fixed a gaze on her mother and said, "All right, but you're here now. What would you suggest I say or do?" </p><p> "That's obvious. You're not a teenager any more, Robin. You're a Starfleet officer, for God's sake. You should have enough confidence to say what's really on your mind. I mean, hell, if you make a mistake at Ops, you have to worry about ramifications for the whole ship, and you do that job perfectly well. Here the only consequences are personal, and certainly they're not life-threatening or even remotely catastrophic. Do the job and stop nattering about like a teenager with a crush on the boy across the schoolyard." </p><p> "You're right. By God, Mother, you're right." Robin squared her shoulder. "If I have feelings for Si Cwan, then I should tell him. I owe it to myself, and in a way I owe it to him." </p><p> "That's right." </p><p> "Because, damn...I'm a good catch." </p><p> "You certainly are," smiled Morgan. </p><p> "And he should have the right to know that someone as high quality as me is interested in him." </p><p> "Exactly the attitude to have." </p><p> "And I can do this without withdrawing. Wish me luck, Mother." </p><p> "Good luck, Robin." </p><p> Robin strode forward. Morgan watched her go, watched the door slide shut behind her. She hesitated a moment, as if reluctant to speak, and then sighed as she called, "Robin. You do realize that's the bathroom." </p><p> "I know. I'm just composing myself. I'll be ten minutes." </p><p> "Now, Robin." </p><p> "Mother, I assure you -- " </p><p> <i>"Now, Robin!"</i> </p><p> The door slid open again and Robin emerged with a tread that could best be described as stomping. "You don't have to talk to me as if I were a child, Mother," she said stiffly. </p><p> "Well, then try not to act like one." </p><p> Robin blew air impatiently through her lips and then, with that same stompish tread, walked out of their quarters. Morgan just shook her head and went back to her reading. </p><p><br> With each stride that she took down the corridor, Robin felt confidence seeping into her. The truth was, she had no reason to doubt herself. She had proven herself as a competent and dedicated officer on the <i>Excalibur.</i> She had served on away teams. She knew the ropes. Indeed, there wasn't a single good reason that she should not be part of the mission. The only type of reason was a bad one -- Si Cwan had gotten to her. </p><p> When she'd first been assigned to be his liaison in his duties as the official "unofficial" ambassador of goodwill aboard the <i>Excalibur,</i> granted she'd found him intriguing. No reason she shouldn't, really. This was a Thallonian noble, after all. Scion and possible last survivor of a royal family, he tried to use goodwill and his considerable personal charisma to stitch together the tattered remains of Thallonian influence. The star-spanning Thallonian Empire, of which he had been a part, was gone. It was obvious after five minutes of conversation with him that he was more than aware of that. What made Si Cwan different from the others of his royal ilk is that he cared, truly cared, about the people who had been affected by the collapse of the Empire. He really, genuinely wanted to make things better, safer. He wanted to make certain that the assorted worlds that had once comprised the Empire, now left to their own devices, would not spiral downward into chaos and anarchy. He did not seem interested in leading so much as guiding. </p><p> Yes, first she had been intrigued by him. And then she was impressed by him. Then she admired him. Then she thought about him more often than not. And then...then... </p><p> "Then what?" she asked herself as she entered the turbolift and ordered it to bring her to deck 12, where Si Cwan's quarters were. </p><p> Si Cwan was not the type to be effusive in his sentiments. It seemed undignified somehow. Beneath him. Even though his titles and rank in the extinct Empire had no relevance in his status quo on the <i>Excalibur,</i> he still maintained a sort of regalness that demanded a reserved, restrained attitude. Consequently, Robin was unable to get any sort of read off him at all as to just how he might feel about her. That was quite frustrating because Robin had always prided herself on her ability to intuit what other people were thinking. Unfortunately, she was getting no such sense from Si Cwan at all. That didn't necessarily mean that he cared nothing for her, but it wasn't a strong indicator that he felt something. </p><p> The problem was that the more time she spent with Si Cwan, the more confident she should have become in her dealings with him. Instead, although she had maintained an outward air of poise, inwardly she was a conflicted mess. She was reasonably sure that her quandaries and internal discontent hadn't spilled over into her interaction with him; certainly no one else had commented to her that anything seemed remotely off. Still, there was that niggling, damnable uncertainty. </p><p> So, when she and Si Cwan had been discussing the impending diplomatic mission to the planet Montos, they had talked in cool, dispassionate terms about who would be the best people to accompany him. What she had wanted to say was that, as his liaison, it would be best if she attended with him. But she didn't trust her judgment. She wasn't sure how much of that sentiment was being generated by genuine belief that she was relevant to the mission or how much came just from her desire to spend an extended amount of time with him. Rather than err on the side of misjudgment prompted by inappropriate or irrelevant concerns, she had kept her silence and been willing to discuss just about anyone except herself. </p><p> That had been a foolish error, and one she would not repeat. Because, dammit, she <i>should</i> go along. That's all there was to it. </p><p> No. That's not all there was to it. Si Cwan deserved to know the reason -- all the reasons -- that she wanted to accompany him. There was simply no way for any sort of progress on their relationship (whatever that might be) to occur if he didn't know what was what. Matters might still be nebulous, in a state of flux, but she had to tell him just what the flux was going on. </p><p> She walked up to his quarters feeling newly emboldened and rang the chime. She heard a voice from within say, "Come," but she barely paid attention to it as her thoughts swirled within her head. Her fists clenched tightly from building tension, she strode in, her eyes closed tightly (as she occasionally did when she was faced with a situation that was emotionally stressful) and blurted out, "Look, I've been keeping this to myself for a while, and I'm not even sure I know what I'm feeling because it needs to get out there so we can talk about it and see what's what, but I have to tell you that I think I'm attracted to you and developing very strong feelings for you that extend beyond our duty-related relationship." </p><p> She opened her eyes. </p><p> Seated quite comfortably on Si Cwan's couch was Captain Mackenzie Calhoun. He was holding what appeared to be one of Si Cwan's Thallonian texts in his hands, and he was staring at Robin Lefler with a carefully neutral expression. </p><p> Then he sighed heavily. </p><p> "It's all right," he said. "I hear that all the time." </p><p> All the blood drained from Robin's face and poured down into her feet; consequently, she thought she was going to pass out, but she wasn't able to move as her boots were firmly anchored. "Captain, I...I..." </p><p> He raised an eyebrow and waited expectantly. </p><p> "Captain, I'm...I'm not attracted to you at all, sir." </p><p> "Oh." A small flicker of what appeared to be disappointment -- or possibly amusement, although Robin wouldn't have been able to discern it at that moment -- danced in his purple-hued eyes. "Well, I hear that all the time, too." </p><p> "That is to say...I'm not...I mean, I..." She cleared her throat, but didn't succeed overmuch for there was still a deep raspiness in there. "Is Si Cwan here?" </p><p> "No. He's not. As you know, we have a diplomatic mission on its way to Montos. Si Cwan felt that, since they were ready to go, there was no point in delaying the departure. So he, and Lieutenants Kebron and Soleta, departed an hour ago on the runabout, Marquand II. However he had some historical texts here in his quarters that he invited me to read. He simply asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble if I read them here, however. He didn't want them circulating around the ship; they're quite old and sacred and, well..." He shrugged. "We all have our quirks, I suppose." </p><p> She nodded, still feeling so mortified that she was having trouble composing anything resembling a coherent sentence, or even a coherent thought. </p>&lt;...</p><h2>Tasha Tudor&#39;s Favorite Christmas Carols</h2><p>An illustrated collection of Christmas carols.</p><p></p><h2>Black Music</h2><p>In the essay Jazz and the White Critic&#x201d; LeRoi Jones observes: Most jazz critics have been white Americans, but most important jazz musicians have not been.&#x201d; In <i>Black Music</i> , his perceptive and provocative collection of articles, reviews, profiles, interviews, liner notes, and new essays, Jones has offered a remedy of sorts. In brilliant discussions of Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Sonny Rollins, Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, Don Cherry, and Sun-Ra, he examines each musician's personality, background, musical ambitions, accomplishments, and disappointments, to illuminate both the context and spirit of jazz.</p><p>This scintillating collection by Amiri Imamu Baraka, published in 1968 under his birth name Leroi Jones, covers a wide range of jazz writings from 1959 to 1967. Baraka's engaging and prophetic portraits of Sonny Rollins, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Bradford, Cecil Taylor, Thelonious Monk, Roy Haynes, Don Cherry, and John Coltrane (whom he called "the heaviest spirit") beam with an electric and fluid language that mirrors those artists' speed-of-light improvisations. In "Jazz and the White Critic," which blasts white critics who judge jazz by European, rather than African American, standards, Jones wrote, "As Western people, the sociocultural thinking of 18th-century Europe comes to us as history and legacy that is a continuous and organic part of the 20th-century West. The sociocultural philosophy of the Negro in America ... is no less specific and no less important for any intelligent critical speculation about the music that came out of it." His analysis of the burgeoning avant-garde scene in "Apple Cores #1-6," "New York Loft and Coffee Shop Jazz," and "The Jazz Avant-Garde" accurately depicts the artistic promise and peril of that period in the words of a literary genius who was there and helped create it. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i>[This collection of pieces] written in the 1960&#39;s provides a clear picture of where one segment of the modern Negro community stands musically--and socially. . . .

Growing up on the prairie and learning to notice the small details it hides gave her an appreciation for watching God at work in His creation. Her upbringing also included being taught to trust God in everything and through everything&#x2014;a theme that resonates in her stories. She and her husband raised fourteen children&#x2014;ten adopted. She currently shares her home with her husband, a grown son and a live-in paraplegic client.<i>Bar Crossing, Montana <br>January 1890</i><br><br>R ose Bell pushed back a scream of frustration. Even so, she spoke with more anger than sorrow. "The poor creatures. Pa, let me off here. You take Ma to the house and I'll take care of these animals." The sheep had been turned out of their pen and one of the older ewes was mired in a snowbank next to the shed. The others milled around, uncertain as to whether they should enjoy their freedom or panic because there were no fences to keep them safe.<br><br>At least they wouldn't drown in the river today. It was frozen over. That was a mercy.<br><br>She hopped down before the wagon stopped moving and raced toward the ewe. "Come on, girl." She pulled and tugged and cooed but the sheep had been there long enough her wool had frozen to the snow, anchoring her firmly.<br><br>"Can I help?"<br><br>With a startled squeak she turned around to stare at Douglas Caldwell, the golden-haired son and heir of the Caldwell family.<br><br>Everyone else called him by his nickname, "Duke," but she couldn't bring herself to. It sounded friendly and neighborly and the Caldwells were anything but that. Pa had bought this bit of land eight years ago and turned it into a productive farm. But it happened to encroach on the boundaries of the Caldwell Ranch. They learned later that the filing clerk had made a mistake. Despite that, the land belonged to the Bells&#x2014;clear and legal.<br><br>To this day Mr. Caldwell refused to accept the facts. He had tried every means he could think of to get them to leave. He'd offered money. He'd talked; at first kindly then threateningly. When none of that worked he'd had his cowboys harass the Bells and their animals. The garden had been trampled a number of times. Caldwell cows had eaten or destroyed portions of the oat crop. Just a few months ago, one of the lambs had drowned when the animals had mysteriously escaped their pasture and found their way to the river. But the worst thing they'd done to date was stampede the cows through the yard as the Bells harvested the garden. Pa had been injured. He still had sore ribs. She knew by the way he moved and the number of naps he took that he felt poorly.<br><br>The cowboys always managed to make their activities look like accidents, so the sheriff couldn't do anything.<br><br>It was on the tip of Rose's tongue to tell young Mr. Caldwell she didn't need his help but he'd already dismounted and come to her side. "It's going to take a good pull to get her out of that."<br><br>"I know."<br><br>He grinned down at her. "Hello, Rose. How have you been?"<br><br>She pushed her hair back under her knit hat.<br><br>His gaze followed the movement of her hands. She half expected him to say something about her red hair as he'd done when they were in early grades at school. Instead his blue eyes darkened and he swallowed hard.<br><br>As if he liked what he saw.<br><br>She pressed her lips tight. The cold must be affecting her brain. Except she wasn't cold. She'd worked up plenty of heat struggling with the ewe.<br><br>Surely she only imagined his look. She stole a glance at him. He still looked at what little of her hair showed from beneath her hat. He still had a bemused look about him.<br><br>Remembering his question, she said, "I've been just fine, Mr. Caldwell. Did Philadelphia survive your visit?"<br><br>He'd been gone a year, visiting his grandparents, and had returned a couple of weeks ago. In time to spend Christmas with his family.<br><br>"Philadelphia won't even notice I've left."<br><br>Odd way to put it. She hadn't given it much mind but if she had, she would have expected him to sound regretful at having to leave the city. No, she hadn't given it much mind, she silently mocked herself. Only thought of it maybe once or twice a day. She'd half expected to see him every time she went to town and every Sunday at church and even when she was out riding. That's what happened when two people grew up in the same community. You got accustomed to seeing each other even if you weren't on friendly terms.<br><br>The young man who seemed to be his new sidekick hurried over to the ewe and fell to his knees at her side. "You poor thing." He wrapped his arms around her neck.<br><br>"Billy, this is our neighbor, Rose Bell." Duke spoke softly, which brought Rose's attention back to him so fast her neck creaked. She preferred to think of Duke as brash. Hearing him speak so gently, so tenderly&#x2014;<br><br>Good grief, she was losing her mind.<br><br>"Rose, this is Billy Taylor."<br><br>Billy got to his feet. "Hi, Rose. Pretty name. Just like your hair." Billy stared at her hair.<br><br>Rose resisted an urge to push it more tightly under her hat. She felt again Duke's study and forced herself to look directly at the young man he'd introduced. "Nice meeting you, Billy."<br><br>Billy's grin was wide and eager. He pressed a hand to his mouth and looked embarrassed.<br><br>It was hard to gauge his age but she guessed him to be in his early twenties. He didn't seem the kind of companion she'd expect Duke to pick. But then, what sort did she expect?<br><br>She couldn't rightly say. She'd done her best to avoid Duke all her life&#x2014;partly because he teased her about her red hair but even more because he was a Caldwell. It had proved difficult to ignore him. They'd attended the same school. He was only a year older so they'd often ended up working together on some project. They'd gone to the same church. They'd even gone to the same gatherings where he'd often managed to become her partner at games.<br><br>Mostly, she assured herself, to annoy her and to tease her about her red hair.<br><br>Duke stepped into the deep snow beside the ewe.<br><br>"What do you think, Billy? How are we going to get her out of this?" The ewe bleated at his arrival.<br><br>"You won't hurt her, will ya?" Billy's face wrinkled with concern. She realized he had the mind of a child, which confused her even more.<br><br>"Not if I can help it." Duke tried to lift the edges of the ewe's fleece. "She's froze in." He stood to his knees in snow, tipped his hat back and scratched his forehead. "I don't know anything about sheep. Can we pull her out?" He turned to Rose.<br><br>She realized she'd been staring at him and jerked her attention back to the sheep. What was wrong with her? She sucked in a steadying breath. The same thing that had been wrong with her the year before he'd left. She'd struggled with reconciling the teasing boy he'd been with the handsome young man he had turned into. He was even more handsome now. His blue eyes drilled into her thoughts and sent them skittering back and forth like the sheep around her. Some running, glad to be free, but then stopping, uncertain what they wanted to do with that freedom.<br><br>Now she was thinking like a stupid sheep. She closed the door to such foolishness. She, Rose Bell, age eighteen, was a levelheaded, practical sort of person. One who dealt calmly with challenges.<br><br>She moved closer to the ewe, which brought her closer to Duke. She stumbled in the deep snow and he caught her by the arm.<br><br>"Steady there." His voice deepened.<br><br>Her cheeks burned and she knew they would be almost as red as her hair. He dropped her arm. A warm spot remained where it had been. She forced her attention to the bleating sheep. "She wouldn't feel it if we pulled her wool free from the ice. Though she'll likely be frightened."<br><br>Billy tipped his head down to meet the ewe's eyes. "We're going to help you so don't be scared. Okay?" He patted her head.<br><br>Just as Lilly would do.<br><br>Rose missed her twin sister so much. And her older sister, Cora, too. Not that she didn't see them almost every Sunday. She even visited Lilly most Saturdays, as well. But Cora had married Wyatt in the fall and Lilly had married Caleb in December. Rose, alone, remained at home. Likely she'd stay with her ma and pa until they passed.<br><br>She was happy for her sisters in their newly wedded state but she didn't figure she'd ever marry. Too many people cared about the background of the Bell sisters&#x2014;or rather, their lack of background.<br><br>Ma and Pa Bell had found the three of them on the prairie when Cora was five and the twins only three. The girls could remember their papa riding away in a wagon with a promise to return, but two days and a night later, he had not. The Bells had taken the girls home and when no birth parents could be located, they'd adopted them. Not everyone approved. Not everyone thought the girls belonged in the community.<br><br>When she was about eight, Rose was in the store with her sisters and Ma. She had wandered down the aisles, fascinated by the display of the many colors of embroidery threads. Two women were in there, as well, and one had said to the other, "I wonder what the Bells have gotten themselves into. Taking in orphans like those girls. Who knows what sort of family they came from? I tell you, there's something wrong with people who would abandon their children, and goodness knows how those traits are passed down to their offspring. Mark my words, you'll see that mental weakness come to light soon enough."<br><br>Then a teacher in school had made a point of calling the girls "adopted" at every opportunity. As if it marked them in a special&#x2014;but not good&#x2014;way.<br><br>All of that she could have overlooked if it hadn't been for her unhappy experience with George Olsen. She'd thought him kind; a gentleman who'd eagerly accompanied her on walks about town.<br><br>But his mother had put an end to that. "We know nothing of their background. It's important to think about that when you court a girl. You never know what kind of family you are getting involved with in Rose's case. What kind of bloodlines does she carry? No, it's better that you know what you're getting into." Mrs. Olsen had been unaware that Rose had seen and heard every word.<br><br>Rose had turned and fled. Her sisters and parents had persuaded her to tell them why she'd been so upset. Ma had hugged her and assured her the only background she needed was to know she was loved. "You are my sweet Red Rose. A young woman with determination in her veins. Rose, my dear, you will someday thank God for giving you your strong nature."<br><br>After that, Rose had forsaken any idea of finding a beau. But she had not thanked God for her strong nature. Or her red hair.<br><br>Cora and Lilly had found men who were willing to overlook their lack of background.<br><br>Rose did not expect to be so fortunate.<br><br>Especially with someone the likes of Duke Caldwell...<br><br>She pressed her hand to her forehead. Where did such foolish thoughts come from?<br><br>Duke watched her with steady eyes filled with concern. "We can't leave her here."<br><br>He'd mistaken her despair for concern for the sheep, not concern for her own security. She knew where caring about a man would lead. Especially a Caldwell.<br><br>Not that she cared about Duke. Not in the least. Never had. Never would.<br><br>She started to pull the wool from the snow, strand by strand.<br><br>Billy murmured comfort to the sheep and Duke worked by Rose's side, following her example. His hands were sure and gentle. He seemed not a bit put out to be helping a sheep even though he was a cattleman and they hated sheep. How many times had she overheard remarks in town? "Woolies destroy the grass. They eat it to the roots. It never grows back."<br><br>She could have told the cowboys they were wrong, but knew there was no point. People believed what they chose to believe.<br><br>But Duke acted as though the ewe was no different than a cow or a horse. Or maybe he didn't care what others thought of sheep.<br><br>It must be sweet to be so sure of oneself.<br><br>"This is Lilly's first ewe. She calls her Mammy. Mammy will come when Lilly calls her." She couldn't stop talking. "But she won't come when I call her. You wouldn't think it would make a difference, would you?"<br><br>"I hear Lilly is married now."<br><br>"And Cora, too. Cora and Wyatt and his brother, Lonny, are on Jack Henry's ranch. You remember Jack Henry?"<br><br>"Yup." He continued loosening wool and she continued her endless chatter.<br><br>"Lilly married Caleb. He has a little son, Teddy. They're in town for now, though Caleb says he'll be getting his own ranch come spring. Right now they want to be in town so Teddy can go to school. He couldn't walk for a while."<br><br>"That so?"<br><br>"It is." And as suddenly as the burst of words had come, they ended. She couldn't think of a thing to say.<br><br>They had Mammy's wool loosened on one side and together they moved to the other.<br><br>A couple of minutes later Duke straightened and stuck his hands on his hips.<br><br>She grinned to herself and ducked her head. His stance should look powerful but with snow up to his knees it only looked as if he might lose his balance.<br><br>"What next?" he asked.<br><br>She waded out of the snowbank and turned to call, "Mammy, come, Mammy."<br><br>Mammy bleated but made no effort to move.<br><br>Rose jammed her hands into fists. "Why will you come when Lilly calls you and refuse to come when I do?"<br><br>Billy hugged the sheep around her neck. "It's okay. She's not mad at you." He backed up. "Come on, Mammy. You don't want to stay here. The snow is cold." As he backed toward Rose, Mammy followed.<br><br>"Good job. How did you do that?" Rose asked Billy, so pleased to see Mammy out of the snowbank she could have hugged the young man.<br><br>Duke chuckled. "Billy gets along well with animals."<br><br>Billy beamed at Duke's praise, then turned to Rose. "Where do you want her?"<br><br>She led him to the sheep pen and Mammy followed, bleating happily to be back inside.<br><br>Rose turned to contemplate the other animals. "Now, if only they would come as easily." Then realizing it sounded as though she meant to ask them to help, she smiled at Billy. "Thanks for your help." She turned to Duke. Her breath stuck halfway up her throat at his wide smile and flashing eyes. Must he look so handsome? So happy? So appealing?<br><br>"Thanks for your help, as well." She managed to squeak the words out.<br><br>"Thank me when we're done." He held her gaze a moment, then turned toward the other milling sheep. "Billy, do you suppose you could call them in?"<br><br>"I'll try... Come, sheepie. Come."<br><br>A couple trotted toward him but the rest acted as though they couldn't hear.<br><br>"Stupid sheep," Rose muttered as she marched around the furthest one&#x2014;the headstrong ram&#x2014;hoping to head it in the right direction. Of course it ran the opposite way.<br><br>Duke ran around the animal, waving his arms.<br><br>"Shoo. Shoo."<br><br>The sheep skidded to a halt and looked around for a way of escape.<br><br>"Shoo. I said shoo." He jerked his hands toward the sheep.<br><br>The sheep baaed and lowered his head. Should she warn him about how the ram reacted to being chased?<br><br>But before she could, Duke jumped toward the ram. She stared at the way the animal backed up, still bleating his protest. He turned tail and trotted toward the pen, never once losing his voice.<br><br>Duke hurried after the ram. "Shoo. Shoo."<br><br>A cowboy on foot chasing a sheep! Who would have thought she'd ever see the day? When she told Lilly, they would get a good laugh out of it.<br><br>Grub, their flop-eared, useless but well-loved dog, loped toward the sheep. Until now he'd been supervising Ma and Pa unloading the wagon, hoping for a handout.<br><br>He ran straight into the midst of the sheep, scattering them every which way.<br><br>Duke's eyes grew wide. "Stop. Shoo. Shoo." He waved his arms madly at the sheep.<br><br>Rose started to giggle.<br><br>Duke pulled to a halt at her side. "Share the joke." She shook her head, not because she didn't want to but because she wondered if he might be offended. He nudged her with his elbow. "No fair. I like a good joke."</p><h2>A Medieval Castle</h2><p>Step inside a medieval castle and discover for yourself what it was like to live and work inside its massive walls.

Informative, colorful cutaway illustrations in conjunction with Macdonald's well-researched texts and captions present accurate and understandable glimpses into their topics. A Medieval Castle covers the planning and construction of the castle and outlying buildings, and gives a description of the inhabitants' way of life. The larger community of laborers, servants, knights, minstrels, and farmers are all included. The approach here is very different from that of David Macaulay's Castle (Houghton, 1977), which focuses on the physical construction. While there are many books on railroads themselves, the stations seldom receive much attention. A 19th Century Railway Station explains how they were built, financed, and decorated, and how train travel affected the lives of people at that time. Railroad employees and their jobs are also detailed. Both books are packed with information, resulting in a somewhat crowded look. They reflect their British origins in the spelling of certain terms and in the choice of examples cited. The marvelously detailed pictures, however, make up for any other small problems.

She also has found love and a new family with the wealthy Martin Palmer and the children she is helping him raise. But almost immediately after her arrival in Owl&#x2019;s Perch, the disapproval of those who ostracized her, including her headstrong father, reopens old wounds.<br><br>As Hannah is thrown together with former fianc� Paul Waddell to work for her sister Sarah&#x2019;s mental health, hidden truths surface about events during Hannah&#x2019;s absence, and she faces an agonizing decision. Will she choose the <i>Englischer</i> world and the man who restored her hope, or will she heed the call to return to the Plain Life&#x2013;and perhaps to her first love? <br><br><i>When the Soul Mends</i> is the third and final book in the Sisters of the Quilt series.</p><p><b>Cindy Woodsmall</b> is the author of <i>When the Heart Cries </i>and <i>When the Morning Comes,</i> the first two novels in the best-selling Sisters of the Quilt series. Her ability to authentically capture the heart of her characters comes from her real-life connections with Amish Mennonite and Old Order Amish families. A mother of three sons and one daughter-in-law, Cindy lives in Georgia with her husband of thirty years.<b>Chapter 1<br></b><br>Hannah&#x2019;s car faded into the distance of the paved horizon. The cold concrete chilling Martin&#x2019;s bare feet and the lukewarm cup of coffee in his hand confirmed that this was no way to begin a Saturday morning. Watching the place where Hannah&#x2019;s vehicle had disappeared, Kevin and Lissa slowly stopped waving. For the first time since Hannah had landed in Ohio&#x2013;two and a half years ago and not yet eighteen&#x2013;she was on her way back to her Pennsylvania home and the Old Order Amish family she&#x2019;d left behind. Maybe he should have insisted on going with her.<br><br>Lissa tugged at the hem of his T-shirt. &#x201c;She packed a lot of stuff.&#x201d; His niece&#x2019;s big brown eyes reflected fears she didn&#x2019;t know how to voice at five years old. Martin tried to catch Kevin&#x2019;s eye to see how he was doing, but he stared at the ground. Hannah really hadn&#x2019;t packed very much, but this had to feel like a replay of when their mother ran off months ago. When Faye had packed a lot of things into her car, she dropped Kevin and Lissa off with Hannah while Martin was at work, and never returned.<br><br>Martin suppressed a sigh, tossed the brown liquid from his cup onto the green grass, and held out his hand to Lissa. &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be back, guys.&#x201d;<br><br>Lissa slid her hand into his. &#x201c;Promise?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. Absolutely.&#x201d; Martin gave her hand a gentle squeeze. &#x201c;Her sister called to say that a good friend of Hannah&#x2019;s had an accident and is in the hospital. She&#x2019;ll probably be back in time for her classes on Monday. Wednesday at the latest.&#x201d;<br><br>Kevin shoved his hands deep into his pockets. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know she had a sister.&#x201d;<br><br>Martin shrugged, unwilling to say too much about Hannah&#x2019;s past. &#x201c;She hasn&#x2019;t been to see her family or friends in Pennsylvania for years.&#x201d; With the coffee cup dangling from his fingers, he put his hand on Kevin&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Now they need her for a bit.&#x201d; He headed for the house, leading the children. Earlier this morning, while Hannah called possible hospitals her friend might have been taken to, Martin found an Ohio-Pennsylvania map. Once she knew the name and address of the hospital, they studied the map together while he highlighted the route she&#x2019;d need to take.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t know which caused her the most nervousness: her injured friend, having to see her family again, or driving in unfamiliar territory, but right now he wished he&#x2019;d pushed a little harder to go with her.<br><br>He thought about the gifts he and Hannah had exchanged last night. He&#x2019;d given her an honorary mother&#x2019;s ring and had slid it onto the ring finger of her left hand. She hadn&#x2019;t agreed yet to marry him, saying his proposal a few weeks back had been brazen and romance-free, which it had. But when he took her to Hawaii over Christmas, he&#x2019;d find the most romantic way possible to propose.<br><br>A smile he couldn&#x2019;t stop seemed to spread across the morning. Martin opened the front door. &#x201c;How about some Cracklin&#x2019; Pops cereal and cartoons?&#x201d;<br><br>---------------<br>The muscles across Hannah&#x2019;s shoulders ached. With the toll roads and service plazas of the Ohio and Pennsylvania Turnpikes behind her, she pulled into the parking lot of the hospital and found a space for her car. Her frazzled nerves complained, but she was here now&#x2013;whatever <i>here </i>held in store. Trying desperately to remember who she&#x2019;d become over the last couple of years, not who she&#x2019;d once been, she stopped at the information desk and waited for the woman to end her phone conversation.<br><br>Her sister Sarah had managed to get hold of her phone number and had called last night to tell her about Matthew being hurt in a fire. Hannah promised to come&#x2013;a pledge she now regretted. In some ways it&#x2019;d been a lifetime since she&#x2019;d last faced her Amish community, yet the quaking of her insides said it&#x2019;d been only yesterday.<br><br>The gray-haired woman hung up the phone. &#x201c;Can I help you?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yes, I need the room numbers for Matthew and David Esh.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman typed on the keyboard and studied the screen. She frowned and typed in more info. &#x201c;We have a Matthew Esh, but there&#x2019;s not a David Esh listed.&#x201d; She jotted down the room number on a small piece of paper. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible he&#x2019;s already been released or perhaps was taken to a different hospital.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe so. I&#x2019;ll ask Matthew.&#x201d; Hannah took the paper from her. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>She went to the elevator, trying to mentally prepare to face Matthew&#x2019;s visitors&#x2013;people she knew, people she was related to, those who&#x2019;d accused her of wrongdoing before they washed their hands of her. <br><br>Nonetheless, she&#x2019;d come home.<br><i><br>Here. Not home. </i>She corrected herself and felt a morsel of comfort in the thought. These people didn&#x2019;t own her and had no power to control her, not anymore. She stepped off the elevator and headed toward Matthew&#x2019;s room. Odd, but the place appeared empty of any Amish. She gave a sideways glance into the waiting room as she passed it. There were no Plain folk in there either.<br><br>Stopping outside the room, Hannah said a silent prayer. Ready or not, she pressed the palms of her hands against the door and eased it open. A man lay in the bed, but she couldn&#x2019;t see his face for the bandages across his eyes. He turned his head toward the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; His voice echoed through the room.<br><b><br></b>&#x201c;Matthew?&#x201d;<br><br>His forehead wrinkled above the bandages, and he clenched his jaw. &#x201c;Just go home...or wherever it is you&#x2019;re livin&#x2019; these days. I got no more use for you.&#x201d;<br><br>She froze. If this is what awaited her from Matthew, one of her few friends, what would the community be like? But maybe the man wasn&#x2019;t Matthew. His body was larger, shoulders thicker and rounded with muscle. His voice was raspy and deeper than she remembered. And Matthew would have visitors, wouldn&#x2019;t he?<br><br>&#x201c;Matthew?&#x201d;<br><br>He shifted in the bed, angling his head.<br><br>&#x201c;It...it&#x2019;s Hannah.&#x201d;<br>Only the soft buzzing sound of electronics could be heard as she waited for his response. Wondering a thousand things&#x2013;whether the eye damage was permanent, why he didn&#x2019;t have a marriage beard, and where everyone was&#x2013;she moved closer to the bed.<br><br>Finally he reached his hand toward her. &#x201c;Hannah Lapp, at last back from the unknown world.&#x201d; Ignoring his unsettling tone, she put her fingers around his outstretched hand and squeezed. &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>The stiltedness of their words said that a lot more than two and a half years had passed between them. He shrugged and then winced, reminding her of the pain he must be in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve lost David...and every part of my business. How do ya expect me to be?&#x201d;<br><br><i>David is dead?<br></i><br>The news twisted her insides, making her fight to respond. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Matthew.&#x201d;<br><br>He eased his hand away from hers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m grateful you came all this way, but I&#x2019;m too tired to talk right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. I understand. Where is everyone?&#x201d;<br><br>The door swooshed open, and a nurse walked in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, miss. He&#x2019;s not to have visitors.&#x201d; She held up a laminated, printed sign that said No Visitors Allowed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d slipped off his door.&#x201d;<br><br>That explained why he didn&#x2019;t have friends or relatives here, but he didn&#x2019;t appear to be in bad enough shape for a doctor to give that order.<br><br>Hannah studied the nurse, but she just shook her head without saying more. The only reason he wouldn&#x2019;t be <i>allowed </i>to have visitors was because he&#x2019;d requested that of the staff. And clearly he didn&#x2019;t want to make an exception for her.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She slid her hand into his once more, wishing she could at least know more about the condition of his eyes. But he seemed in no mood for questions. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come back when you&#x2019;re feeling better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no sense in that. I&#x2019;m goin&#x2019; home tomorrow. But...David&#x2019;s funeral is Monday.&#x201d; His voice cracked, and he took a ragged breath. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re still here, we could meet up afterward while <i>Mamm </i>and everyone is distracted with the gatherin&#x2019; at the house.&#x201d;<br><br>The words Matthew didn&#x2019;t say weighed heavily. He didn&#x2019;t want her going into the community to see anyone. He wanted to meet her alone, in secret.<br><br>Unable to respond, she grappled with the space separating them. She&#x2019;d expected distance from her <i>Daed </i>and Mamm, the church leaders, and even Gram, but she hadn&#x2019;t for one second thought Matthew would sidestep her. He&#x2019;d understood, even disobeyed the bishop to help her. Built the coffin for her baby, dug the grave, and said the prayer. Taken her to the train station, bought her a ticket, and stayed with her until time for the train to depart the next day. Did he now regret that he&#x2019;d stuck by her?<br><br>Unwilling to push for a specific plan, Hannah gave his hand a final squeeze before pulling away. &#x201c;Sure. I...I&#x2019;ll catch up with you then.&#x201d;<br><br>Desperate to clear her mind, Hannah hurried out of the hospital and into her car. She pulled out of the hospital parking lot and drove&#x2013;to where, she didn&#x2019;t know. Old feelings of loneliness washed over her, but she kept driving, as if she could outrun the sting. By the time her emotions began to settle, she had no idea where she was. Glancing in the rearview mirror, she pulled her car onto the shoulder of the road. Fields of yet-uncut hay seemed to go on forever as cars whizzed past. <br><br>Unsure of the county or town she was in, she grabbed the map off the seat beside her and searched for her location. Nothing looked familiar. Realizing the stupid thing was upside down, she flipped it around.<br><br>At this moment all she wanted was to be at home with Martin, but the next few days had to be walked through first. She&#x2019;d given Sarah her word. Even as that thought crossed her mind, she wondered if there was more to it. If maybe some deeply hidden part of her wanted to be here.<br><br>Desperate to hear Martin&#x2019;s voice, to feel like she did when with him, she took her cell phone out of her purse.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, sweetheart, where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>A sense of belonging washed over her the moment she heard his voice. &#x201c;I was hoping you could tell me.&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed. &#x201c;Are you serious?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, sort of.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know the name of the road you&#x2019;re on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. All I know is I want to be there, not here.&#x201d; In spite her effort to sound upbeat, she came across as pathetic and didn&#x2019;t want to imagine what Martin must be thinking about now.<br><br>&#x201c;Look at the directions I printed out, and tell me what point you got to before you became lost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I turned left out of your driveway.&#x201d;<br><br>His low chuckle was reassuring. &#x201c;Very cute.&#x201d;<br><br>Determined to show Martin she could handle this, she studied the map. &#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;ve told me that before, only then you could see me.&#x201d;<br><br>She angled the map sideways. &#x201c;Wait. I got it. I know where I am.&#x201d; She pressed her fingertip against the map and followed the line before realizing she was wrong. &#x201c;Lost without you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Metaphorically, I love the sound of that, but you should have let me take you there. You&#x2019;ve never driven anywhere outside a twenty-five mile radius of Winding Creek.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not helping.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a little hard to help from here with no&#x201d;&#x2013;he mockingly cleared his throat&#x2013;&#x201c;POB to work from.&#x201d;<br>She heard the familiar beeps of his laptop starting up. &#x201c;POB...ah, engineering lingo.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep. Point of beginning. I&#x2019;m logging onto Google maps right now and will try the satellite visual. Tell me about your surroundings.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh yeah, that&#x2019;s a great plan. I&#x2019;m surrounded by cow pastures and no houses. Found the right spot yet? There&#x2019;s a Holstein watching me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On Google maps, no. The right spot for you? Yes, it&#x2019;s right here in Ohio with us.&#x201d;<br><br>She heard the rustle of fabric. &#x201c;Did you go back to bed after I left?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ate breakfast and watched cartoons with Lissa and Kevin. But then Laura arrived, so I let the nanny do her job while I took a nice long nap, until you became a damsel in distress. The Mary Jane to my Peter Parker.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? Damsel in distress,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;So what does that make you when you don&#x2019;t know the difference between a skillet and a pot?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A typical male who just happens to be...&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Come on, work with me here, phone girl. Who just happens to be...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Charming and intelligent.&#x201d; She mimicked his clearing of the throat. &#x201c;According to him.&#x201d;<br><br>He laughed. A loud crash echoed through her cell. Lissa screamed, and Hannah&#x2019;s breath caught.<br><br>A bang, as if his door had been shoved open and hit the wall, filtered through the receiver. &#x201c;Uncle Martin, Laura said you better come see this. Lissa might need stitches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Phone girl, I&#x2019;ll need to call you back in a few. Okay?&#x201d;<br><br>The next sound she heard was the complete silence of a cell-phone disconnection. Wondering what she was doing here rather than being there to help Martin, she closed her phone. At sixty-two, Laura was a skilled nanny, but Hannah wanted to be the one with him going through whatever the day brought.<br><br>Looking at the map one last time, she thought about calling Dr. Lehman. He was more than just her boss, and he regularly visited relatives in Lancaster, some forty miles southeast of here, so he might be able to help her. But rather than chance disturbing him, she decided to continue driving until she found a landmark she recognized. She pulled back onto the road. After a solid hour and many times of turning around, she found the road that led to Owl&#x2019;s Perch. Martin hadn&#x2019;t called her back, and she hadn&#x2019;t been able to reach him. His voice mail picked up immediately, which meant his phone was turned off. Whatever was going on, she bet his Saturday was tough, nanny&#x2019;s help or not.<br><br>The oddest sensation slid up her back as she drove alongside the Susquehanna River. She&#x2019;d been in this very spot three years ago, heading for Hershey Medical Center because Luke and Mary had been taken there by helicopter after their accident. She remembered the days that followed, months of hiding her rape from everyone but her parents and hoping against hope that she wouldn&#x2019;t lose Paul.<br><br>&#x201c;Brilliant, Hannah, you were afraid of losing a jerk.&#x201d; She mumbled the words, then turned the radio up louder, trying to drown out the whispers of resentment against him. The familiar territory had to be the reason for the fresh edge of offense that cut against her insides. In all the time she&#x2019;d known Paul, he&#x2019;d lived on a college campus not far from here, except for the summers, when he stayed with his Gram. She&#x2019;d only seen this area twice before, once on the way to the hospital to see Luke and<br><br>Mary and again about two weeks later on the way back home, but in each instance she&#x2019;d been keenly aware that she was in Paul&#x2019;s stomping grounds. At the time she felt connected to him, hopeful they could overcome the obstacles that stood between them and getting married. <i>Silly, childish dreams. <br><br></i>Needing a stronger diversion than worship songs, she pushed the radio button, jumping through the stations until she found a familiar song by Rascal Flatts, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Moving On.&#x201d; She cranked up the sound full blast and sang along, assuring her anxieties that she would survive the oddity of being here as well as the misery of not being with Lissa throughout whatever ordeal she faced.<br><br>The waters of the Susquehanna weren&#x2019;t brown and frothy this time. The river looked crystal clear as the afternoon sun rode across the ripples. In less than an hour she&#x2019;d be in Owl&#x2019;s Perch, and as badly as she wanted to arrive, she didn&#x2019;t want to face her ...</p><h2>Paul Revere : Son of Liberty (Easy Biographies)</h2><p>Recounts the early life of the boy who grew up to become a famous silversmith and Revolutionary War patriot.</p><p></p><h2>Design Since 1945</h2><p>The catalogue of an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, October 16, 1983 - January 8, 1984.

A thrilling and compelling story of a horrific series of crimes and one man&#39;s single-minded resolve to bring the killers to justice. With blood stains on the walkway and screams often heard late at night, the long concrete pathway skirting the cliff face between the beaches of Bondi and Tamarama in Sydney&#39;s Eastern suburbs was dubbed the Bondi Badlands - and it was here in the late 1980s that a handful of young men were dragged to their deaths after nightfall. The slow road to an overdue justice began when Detective Sergeant Stephen Page read a series of letters from a distraught mother of one of the victims. Painstakingly piecing together the dark mural of the murders, he revived the police investigation into the deaths, code-named Operation Taradale. Told with all the excitement and pace of a crime thriller, this story of the Bondi Badlands murders is unputdownable.</p><p>In a career spanning more than 20 years, Greg Callaghan has written for most of the major newspapers and magazines in Australia.

Relive with him his years with Paramhansa Yogananda in the monastic order of Self Realization Fellowship. Experience with him incredible visions and encounters with beings of other dimensions, culminating in a meeting with a living being of light called I AM THAT I AM. The image of the Pure Self within has been seen by many people, of all faiths, in near-death experiences as a light at the end of an inner dimensional tunnel. An encounter with this living Being of Light is available to you through advanced techniques of meditation.</p><p>At the age of seventeen, Norman Paulsen&#39;s search for God led him to join the monastery of Paramahansa Yogananada, where he received instruction in an ancient technique of meditation and began to become conscious of the presence of Divine Spirit. As related in his autobiography, &#34;The Christ Consciousness,&#34; his continued efforts produced a face to face meeting with that Being of Light called I Am That I Am, Christ.

Following the brutal assassination of her husband, Si Cwan, former Starfleet officer-turned-newly-appointed-Prime Minister Robin Lefler must now face the growing danger and intrigue surrounding her newborn son and heir to the noble line of Cwan. Following a harrowing assassination attempt, Robin has no choice but to flee New Thallon with her child...seeking refuge with Captain Mackenzie Calhoun and the crew of the <i>U.S.S. Excalibur</i> and creating a major diplomatic crisis in Sector 221-G. <br> <br> The political fallout between the Federation and the New Thallonian Protectorate pales, however, in comparison to the threat of an enigmatic alien race determined to seize the infant Cwan for its own mysterious purposes. But nothing could possibly prepare Calhoun for the shocking betrayal from within -- an act of treachery to aid and abet this alien race -- forever altering the lives of the <i>Excalibur</i> crew....</p><p>Peter David is a prolific writer whose career, and continued popularity, spans more than twenty-five years.

Seated in his ready room, he put aside the ancient Xenexian battle axe that he had recently acquired and looked up with a quizzical expression at Tania Tobias. The conn officer was standing just inside the door, shifting uncomfortably, fiddling with the trailing ends of her hair.</p><p>"S/he did?"</p><p>Tobias nodded.</p><p>"I apologize," he said, "if hir doing so made you feel uncomfortable, Lieutenant, and I assure you that -- "</p><p>"I wasn't offended, Captain."</p><p>"Oh." Calhoun took pride in his ability to react quickly and authoritatively to any situation. It was that resourcefulness that had enabled him and his crew to survive many hazardous situations. Yet he occasionally found himself disoriented when talking with his eclectic crew members, and this was one of those occasions. "So this is not something I should be concerned about?"</p><p>"I think you should be, yes."</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, resisting the temptation to throw his hands up in surrender.</p><p>His bewilderment must have been evident to Tobias, because she said apologetically, "I'm sorry if I lost you, Captain."</p><p>"I wouldn't say you've lost me, Lieutenant," he said, without adding aloud, <i>I was never following you to begin with.</i> "I am a bit unclear on what the precise nature of your complaint is. Do you see this as a disciplinary matter?"</p><p>"I see it as cause for concern."</p><p>"Why? Burgy has always been rather licentious by nature. Granted, s/he curtailed that when s/he became involved with Doctor Selar, but they never actually married and the relationship seems to have gone by the wayside. So I don't see that there are any moral issues in the mix."</p><p>"It's nothing like that, Captain. I'm sorry, I haven't been makingmyself clear."</p><p><i>No kidding.</i> He forced a smile, which caused the edges of his mouth to hurt from the unaccustomed muscle strain. "Well, then, perhaps clarification might be in order at some point within our lifetimes."</p><p>She gave no indication that she noticed the gentle dig. "The problem is," she said, "that when s/he propositioned me, hir heart wasn't in it."</p><p>"I don't understan -- " But then his voice trailed off as he comprehended her meaning.</p><p>Tobias, still in that gentle obliviousness that was her foremost characteristic, didn't realize that further explanation was unnecessary. "When Burgoyne makes hir interest known to people, s/he's very enthused. S/he..." Tobias paused, trying to determine the best way to put it. "When hir attention is on you in that way, s/he makes you feel as if you're the only person in the entire galaxy. That there's nothing else s/he would rather be doing than gazing into your eyes." Her voice was soft and languorous, and she was looking dreamily off to the side as if she had mentally departed the ready room several minutes earlier. "That's how s/he does it. S/he just makes you come alive. Appeals to sensuous aspects of your personality that you hadn't dreamed could possibly -- "</p><p>Calhoun cleared his throat loudly, and the interruption snapped Tobias from her reverie. She looked momentarily confused, as if she had forgotten where she was. Quickly composing herself, she said, "At least that's what I've heard."</p><p>"Obviously heard and thought about a good deal."</p><p>"The point is, s/he wasn't that way with me. S/he just seemed to be -- "</p><p>"Going through the motions?"</p><p><i>"Yes!"</i> she said excitedly as if Calhoun had just produced three doves from his sleeve. "Yes, that's exactly it. Going through the motions. S/he was doing it because s/he thought it was expected of hir, or maybe because s/he felt maybe s/he could make hirself feel a certain way."</p><p>"And your concern is that if s/he's off hir game in this manner, it could negatively affect the way s/he carries out hir duties as first officer?"</p><p>"I hadn't even thought about that, to be honest. My concern was that a friend was in trouble." She tilted her head and looked at him with open curiosity. "That wasn't your concern, Captain?"</p><p>"Of course it was," said Calhoun, who was a bit disturbed that it had not, in fact, occurred to him. "I just...I hadn't noticed anything that 'off ' about Burgy. Then again, since Burgoyne has never propositioned me, that could be why it slipped past."</p><p>"Well then," she said briskly, "I've done what I needed to do. I'm sure you can handle it from here, Captain."</p><p>"I appreciate the vote of confidence, Lieutenant."</p><p>Tobias walked out of the ready room. Calhoun watched her go, and wondered what the best way was to proceed on the matter. Mackenzie Calhoun, one of the foremost strategists in all of Starfleet, couldn't conceive of how to handle it. What was he supposed to say? He could have found a means of addressing it if he had noticed some sort of deterioration in Burgy's performance of hir duties, but that had not been the case. Calhoun had been caught off guard by Tobias's concerns specifically because he had not, in fact, noticed anything wrong with the way Burgoyne 172 was conducting hirself. "How am I supposed to approach hir on this?"</p><p>"Have you considered doing so as a friend?"</p><p>Calhoun was startled, which was not something that happened often. When it did occur, though, Morgan Primus was more often than not involved somehow. This time was no exception, although one would not have known at first glance that it was, in fact, Morgan, because she had assumed the exact likeness of Mackenzie Calhoun. His clone might as well have walked into the room.</p><p>"Ask how things are going in a general way," the duplicate Calhoun said, "and see if s/he presents an opening. Doesn't that seem practical?"</p><p>"Change back to yourself, Morgan." He did nothing to keep the irritation from his voice. "It's just that you are the only person you ever feel comfortable consulting. Except, of course -- " and abruptly Elizabeth Shelby, Calhoun's wife, was in front of him.</p><p>"Morgan -- "</p><p>To Calhoun's surprise, "Elizabeth" sauntered toward him. Every movement, every aspect of her appearance was indistinguishable from the original. She even had Elizabeth's smile down. Calhoun was standing behind his desk, and the image of his wife came around the desk and cradled his chin in her hand. "Morgan..."</p><p>"I can be her, if you wish," said the mouth of Elizabeth Shelby. "It would benefit you tremendously."</p><p>"Would it?"</p><p>" You're becoming isolated and increasingly frustrated, Mac, because you'rehere and your wife is off commanding Bravo station. It's not fair to either of you, but it's particularly unfair to you. You could use the diversion. Release all manner of endorphins. Put you back on your game."</p><p>"I was unaware I was off it. You need to step back, Morgan." She rested a hand on his chest. "I am simply trying to -- " Calhoun grabbed her wrist and, gripping it firmly, said, "Step. Back."</p><p>Morgan did so, pulling her hand free. Her appearance rippled and the holographic form of Morgan Primus changed back into her normal image. "Burgoyne isn't the only one who could use a little intimate time, is all that I'm saying." </p><p>"I know what you're saying. Now listen to what I'm saying: I'm going to order Tobias and Xy to run a complete diagnostic of your operating systems."</p><p>Morgan smiled. "I don't see that that's necessary, Captain."</p><p>"I say that it is. And since I'm the captain, I have to think that my feelings on the matter take precedence over yours. Are you disputing that, Morgan?"</p><p>"No, but -- "</p><p>"There's no 'but' involved in this, Morgan. Obviously you don'trealize it, but you haven't been yourself since you rebooted."</p><p>"And here I thought you were happy to see me return from the dead."</p><p>"I was. We all were. Even though I'm not entirely certain that what happened to you counts as 'dead.' But your behavior has become increasingly erratic in recent months."</p><p>She drew herself up, fixing him with a stern glance. "Have I been less than diligent in fulfilling my duties as ops officer? To say nothing of being the heart of this ship's operating systems."</p><p>"No, you have not."</p><p>"Then I do not understand the reasoning behind a full diagnostic. It is an intrusive procedure and the prospect makes me uncomfortable."</p><p>"You're a computer entity, Morgan, whatever else you may have been in your previous life. The fact that you would find it uncomfortable alone should tell you something, shouldn't it?"</p><p>She paused, not having an immediate response, and then shrugged as if the matter were simply not worth pursuing. "As you say, you're the captain."</p><p>"Thank you for that acknowledgment," he said, trying not to sound sarcastic and only partly succeeding.</p><p>"By the way, you'll probably want to get out onto the bridge. Something new is about to start."</p><p>"Something new? What are you -- ?"</p><p>His comm badge beeped at him. He tapped it, never taking his eyes from Morgan. "Calhoun, go."</p><p>The voice of Zak Kebron, security chief, came back to him. "Long-range scanners are picking up something, Captain. A ship floating."</p><p>"Derelict? Or survivors?"</p><p>"Impossible to determine from this distance, sir."</p><p>"Then let's cut that distance down, Mr. Kebron. On my way."</p><p>Calhoun strode toward the door as Morgan stepped aside. "Captain," she said.</p><p>He turned toward her and froze.</p><p>She had reassumed the image of Elizabeth Shelby, and she was stark naked. She was also smiling in a come-hither manner. "In case you change your mind, just call my name. Or hers. Never underestimate the power of a good endorphin rush." Morgan vanished before he could say anything further.</p><p><i>"Grozit,"</i> he murmured.<br><br></p><p><b>ii.</b><br></p><p>Commander Burgoyne arched an eyebrow upon seeing Calhoun emerge from the ready room. "Captain, are you all right?"</p><p>"I'm fine, Burgy."</p><p>"Because you're walking rather oddly -- "</p><p>"I said I'm fine," Calhoun said impatiently. Moving quickly, he sat in his command chair and crossed his legs. Burgoyne considered this a bit odd, since Calhoun tended to stand or move about the bridge like a caged cat. "What have we got?"</p><p>"Single-pilot vessel drifting at 325 mark...</p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Eat This Book</h2><p>Humorously documents the author&#39;s famous experiment during which he ate all fast foods for one month to record the impact of such a diet on human health, a study after which he traveled across country into schools, hospitals, and homes to educate the American public about health issues and physical education.

My parents aren't idiots. I don't think they want to die. (When I was younger, there were times when I wanted to kill them, but that's different.) We all know that tobacco is extremely addictive. And that the tobacco companies used to add chemicals to make cigarettes even more addictive, until they got nailed for it. And that for several generations&#x2014;again, until they got busted for it&#x2014;the big tobacco companies aimed their marketing and advertising at kids and young people. Big Tobacco spent billions of dollars to get people hooked as early as they could, and to keep them as "brand-loyal" slaves for the rest of their unnaturally shortened lives. Cigarettes were cool, cigarettes were hip, cigarettes were sexy. Smoking made you look like a cowboy or a movie starlet.<br><br>And it worked. When my parents were young, everybody smoked. Doctors smoked. Athletes smoked. Pregnant women smoked. Their kids came out of the womb looking around the delivery room for an ashtray to ash their Lucky Strikes. Everyone smoked.<br><br>The change began in 1964, when the first surgeon general's warning about smoking and cancer scared the bejesus out of everybody. In 1971, cigarette ads were banned from TV, and much later they disappeared from billboards. Little by little, smoking was restricted in airplanes and airports, in public and private workplaces, in restaurants and bars. Tobacco sponsorship of sporting events decreased. Tighter controls were placed on selling cigarettes to minors. Everyone didn't quit overnight, but overall rates of smoking began to decrease&#x2014;from 42 percent of adults in 1965 to 23 percent in 2000, and from 36 percent of high school kids in 1997 to 29 percent in 2001. The number of adults who have never smoked more than doubled from 1965 to 2000.<br><br>Big tobacco companies knew it was a war they couldn't win, but they didn't give up without a fight. They threw billions and billions of more dollars into making smoking look cool, hip, sexy&#x2014;and safe. They targeted new markets, like women, who increased their rate of smoking 400 percent <i>after</i> the surgeon general's report. Yeah, you've come a long way, baby&#x2014;all the way from the kitchen to the cancer ward. They expanded their markets in the Third World and undeveloped nations, getting hundreds of millions of people hooked; it's estimated that more than four out of five current smokers are in developing countries. As if people without a regular source of drinking water didn't have enough to worry about already. Big Tobacco denied the health risks of smoking, lied about what they were putting into cigarettes and lobbied like hell against every government agency or legislative act aimed at curbing their deadly impact.<br><br>Which brings me back to those "frivolous" lawsuits. Back when people were first suing the tobacco companies for giving them cancer, a lot of folks scoffed. (And coughed. But they still scoffed.) Smokers knew the dangers of smoking, everyone said. If they decided to keep smoking for thirty, forty years and then got lung cancer, they couldn't blame the tobacco companies.<br><br>Then a funny thing happened. As the lawsuits progressed, it became more and more apparent that smokers did <i>not</i> know all the dangers of smoking. They couldn't know, because Big Tobacco was hiding the truth from them&#x2014;lying to them about the health risks, and lying about the additives they were putting in cigarettes to make them more addictive. Marketing cigarettes to children, to get them hooked early and keep them puffing away almost literally from the cradle to the early grave, among other nefarious dealings.<br><br>In the mid-1990s, shouldering the crushing burden of soaring Medicare costs due to smoking-related illnesses, individual states began to imitate those "ambulance-chasers," bringing their own class-action lawsuits against Big Tobacco. In 1998, without ever explicitly admitting to any wrongdoing, the big tobacco companies agreed to a massive $246 billion settlement, to be paid to forty-fix states and five territories over twenty-five years. (The other four states had already settled in individual cases.)<br><br>Two hundred and forty-six billion dollars is a whole lot of frivolous, man.<br><br>What these lawsuits drove home was the relationship between personal responsibility and corporate responsibility. Suddenly it was apparent that sticking a cigarette in your mouth was not <i>quite</i> the same thing as sticking those sneaker mints in your mouth. No one spent billions and billions of dollars in marketing, advertising and promotions telling that guy those sneaker mints would make him cool, hip and sexy. Big Tobacco did exactly that to smokers.<br><br>Still, a lot of people were skeptical about those lawsuits. Are the big bad corporations with all their big bad money and big bad mind-altering advertising really so powerful that we as individuals cannot think for ourselves anymore? Are we really so easily swayed by the simplest of pleasant images that we'll jump at the chance to share in some of that glorious, spring-scented, new and improved, because-you-deserve-it goodness, without a thought about what's best for us anymore?<br><br>You tell me. Every waking moment of our lives, we swim in an ocean of advertising, all of it telling us the same thing: Consume. Consume. And then consume some more.<br><br>In 2003, the auto industry spent $18.2 billion telling us we needed a new car, more cars, bigger cars. Over the last twenty-five years, the number of household vehicles in the United States has doubled. The rate of increase in the number of cars, vans and SUVs for personal travel has been six times the rate of population increase. In fact, according to the Department of Transportation, there are now, for the first time in history, <i>more cars than drivers</i> in America. That's ridiculous!<br><br>Did we suddenly <i>need</i> so many more vehicles? Or were we sold the idea?<br><br>We drive everywhere now. Almost nine-tenths of our daily travel takes place in a personal vehicle. Walking, actually using the legs and feet God gave us, accounts for appallingly little of our day-to-day getting around. Even on trips of under one mile, according to the Department of Transportation, we walked only 24 percent of the time in 2001 (and rode a bike under 2 percent). Walking declined by almost half in the two decades between 1980 and 2000. In Los Angeles, you can get arrested for walking. The cops figure if you're not in a car you can't be up to any good. If you're not in a car, you're a vagrant. Same goes for the suburbs, where so many of us now live.<br><br>And what do you put inside that SUV, minivan or pickup truck you're driving everywhere, other than your kids? Well, lots of <i>stuff,</i> that's what. In 2002, the retail industry in this country spent $13.5 billion telling us what to buy, and we must have been listening, because in 2003 we spent nearly $8 <i>trillion</i> on all kinds of crap. That's right, trillion. How insane is that? We are the biggest consuming culture on the planet. We buy almost twice as much crap as our nearest competitor, Japan. We spend more on ourselves than the entire gross national product of any nation in the world.<br><br>And all that shopping&#x2014;whew, has it made us hungry. Every year, the food industry spends around $33 billion convincing us that we're famished. So we all climb back into our giant vehicle filled with all our stuff from Wal-Mart, and we cruise to the nearest fast-food joint. If not McDonald's or Burger King or Taco Bell, then a "fast casual" restaurant like Outback Steakhouse or TGI Friday's or the Olive Garden, where they serve us portions larger than our smallest kid, with the calories to match.<br><br>What does all that consumption do for us? Does it make us happy? You tell me. If we were all so happy, would we be on so many drugs? Antidepressant use in the U.S. nearly <i>tripled</i> in the past decade. We've got drugs in America we can take for anything: if we're feeling too bad, too good, too skinny, too fat, too sleepy, too wide awake, too unmanly. We've got drugs to counteract the disastrous health effects of all our overconsumption&#x2014;diet drugs, heart drugs, liver drugs, drugs to make our hair grow back and our willies stiff. In 2003, we Americans spent $227 billion on medications. That's a whole lot of drugs!<br><br>This is the power of advertising at work, of billions of hooks that've been cast into our heads in the last thirty years, billions of messages telling us what we want, what we need and what we should do to feel happy. We all buy into it to some degree, because none of us is as young as we'd like to be, or as thin, or as strong.<br><br>Yet none of the stuff we consume&#x2014;no matter how much bigger our SUV is than our neighbor's, no matter how many Whoppers we wolf down, no matter how many DVDs we own or how much Zoloft we take&#x2014;makes us feel full, or satisfied or happy.<br><br>So we consume some more.<br><br>And the line between personal responsibility and corporate responsibility gets finer and more blurred. Yes, you're still responsible for your own life, your own health, your own happiness. But your <i>desires,</i> the things you <i>want,</i> the things you think you <i>need&#x2014;</i>that's all manipulated by corporate advertising and marketing that now whisper and shout and wink at you from every corner of your life&#x2014;at home, at work, at school, at play.<br><br>Consume. Consume. Still not happy? Then you obviously haven't consumed enough.<br><br>Like this book, the epidemic of over consumption that's plaguing the nation begins with the things we put in our mouths. Since the 1960s, everyone has known that smoking kills, but it's only been in the last few years that we've become hip to a new killer, one that now rivals smoking as the leading cause of preventable deaths in America and, if current trends continue, will soon be the leading cause: overeating.<br><br>Americans are eating themselves to death.</p></p><h2>Power from the wind</h2><p>Power From The Wind by Palmer Cosslett Putnam - hardcover</p><p></p><h2>Green-Wood (Heretical Texts, Vol. 5)</h2><p>Poetry.

She died March 26th, 2011.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>I may as well start with some of our deep secrets because this account will not be easy to understand without them.</p><p><br>All over the multiverse, the sign for Infinity or Eternity is a figure eight laid on its side. This is no accident, since it exactly represents the twofold nature of the many worlds, spread as they are in the manner of a spiral nebula twisted like a M�bius strip to become endless. It is said that the number of these worlds is infinite and that more are added daily. But it is also said that the Emperor Koryfos the Great caused this multiplicity of worlds somehow by conquering from Ayewards to Naywards.</p><p><br>You may take your pick, depending on whether you are comfortable with worlds infinitely multiplying, or prefer to think the number stable. I have never decided.</p><p><br>Two facts, however, are certain: one half of this figure eight of worlds is negative magically, or Naywards, and the other half positive, or Ayewards; and the Empire of Koryfos, situated across the twist at the centre, has to this day the figure-eight sign of Infinity as its imperial insignia.<br>This sign appears everywhere in the Empire, even more frequently than statues of Koryfos the Great. I have reason to know this rather well. About a year ago, I was summoned to the Empire capital, Iforion, to attend a judicial enquiry. Some very old laws required that a Magid should be present&#x2014;otherwise I am sure they would have done without me, and I could certainly have done without them. The Koryfonic Empire is one of my least favourite charges. It is traditionally in the care of the most junior Magid from Earth and I was at that time just that. I was tired too. I had only the day before returned from America, where I had, almost single-handed, managed to push the right people into sorting out some kind of peace in the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland. But all my pride and pleasure in this vanished when I saw the summons. Groaning to myself, I put on the required purple bands and cream silk brocade garments and went to take my seat in the closed court.</p><p><br>My first peevish, jet-lagged thought was, Why can&#x2019;t they use one of the nice rooms? The great Imperial Palace has parts that go back over a thousand years and some of those old courts and halls are wonderful. But this enquiry was in a new place, lined with rather smelly varnished wood, bleak and box-like and charmless. And the wooden benches were vilely uncomfortable. The figure-eight insignia&#x2014;carved in relief and painted too bright a gold&#x2014;dug into my shoulders and dazzled off the walls and off the big wooden chair provided for the Emperor. I remember irritably transferring my gaze to the inevitable statue of Koryfos the Great, looming in the corner. That was new too, and picked out in over-bright gilt, but there is this to be said for Koryfos: he had a personality. Though the statues are always the same and always idealized, you could never mistake them for anything but the likeness of a real person. He carried his head on one side, a bit like Alexander the Great of Earth, and wore a vague, cautious smile that said, &#x201c;I hear what you say, but I&#x2019;m going to do things my way anyway.&#x201d; You could see he was obstinate as sin.</p><p><br>I remember I was wondering why the Empire so loved Koryfos&#x2014;he reigned for a bare twenty years over two millennia ago, and most of the time he was away conquering places, but they persist in regarding his time as the Golden Age&#x2014;when we had to stand up for the entrance of the present Emperor. A very different person, small, plain and dour. You do wonder how it is that Emperors always marry the most beautiful women in several worlds and yet produce someone like Timos IX whom you would hardly notice in the street. You would glance at him and think that this was a short man with weak eyes and a chip on his shoulder. Timos IX was one of very few in the Empire who needed to wear glasses. This embarrassed me as I stood up. I was the only other person in the court in spectacles&#x2014;as if I were setting up to be the Emperor&#x2019;s equal. In many ways, of course, a Magid <i>is</i> the equal of any ruler, but in this particular court of enquiry I was a mere onlooker, there by law to certify simply whether or not the accused had broken the law as stated. I was not even supposed to speak until after a verdict had been reached.</p><p><br>This, among other legal facts, was tediously made known to me in the preliminaries after, we all sat down and the prisoner was marched in and made to stand in the centre. He was a pleasant-looking youngster of twenty-one or so, called Timotheo. He did not look like a law-breaker. I am afraid that, apart from registering, with some perplexity, that Timotheo was an alias and that, for obscure legal reasons, his real name could not be given, I could not force my jet-lagged mind to attend very well. I remember going back to my thoughts of Koryfos the Great. He stood to the Empire in the place of a religion, it seemed to me. The wretched place had religions in plenty, over a thousand godlets and goddities, but the worship of these was a purely personal thing. As an example of how personal, I recalled that Timos IX had, about fifteen years ago, adopted the worship of a peculiarly unlovable goddess who inhabited a bush planted on the grave of a dead worshipper and who imposed on her followers a singularly joyless code of morals. This probably explained the Emperor&#x2019;s pinched and gloomy look. But no one else at court had felt the need to adopt the Emperor&#x2019;s faith. It was Koryfos who united everyone.</p><p><br>Here I was jerked to alertness. The Emperor himself read out the charges against the young man in elaborate legal language. Stripped of the law-talk it was appalling, even for the Empire. The so-called Timotheo was the Emperor&#x2019;s eldest son. The decree he was said to have broken stated that no child of the Emperor, by any of his True Wives, High Ladies or Lesser Consorts, was to know who his or her parents were. The penalty for discovering who they were was death. And death for anyone who helped an Imperial child find out.</p><p><br>The Emperor then asked Timotheo if he had broken this decree.</p><p><br>Timotheo had evidently known no more of this decree than I had. He was looking as shocked and angry as I felt. I could have applauded when he answered drily, &#x201c;Sire, if I hadn&#x2019;t broken it before, I would have broken it when you read out my parentage just now.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;But have you broken the decree?&#x201d; the Emperor reiterated.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Timotheo.</p><p><br>Catch-22, I thought. I was furious. What a charade!</p><p><br>The worst of it was that Timotheo was intelligent as well as pleasant. He would have made a much better Emperor than his father. It had obviously taken some ingenuity to find out who he was. He had been one of four fosterlings in the house of a provincial noble and, as the enquiry proceeded, it became clear that the other three fosterlings and the noble must have given him some help. But Timotheo stuck to it that he had done the detective work and made the discovery by himself. Then he had made the bad mistake of writing to his mother, the Emperor&#x2019;s First Consort, for confirmation.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Did it not occur to you that, once you were known, my enemies might kidnap you in order to threaten me?&#x201d; the Emperor asked him.</p><p><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t going to tell anyone,&#x201d; Timotheo said. &#x201c;Besides, I can look after myself.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Then you were intending to claim the Imperial throne for yourself,&#x201d; the Emperor suggested.</p><p><br>&#x201c;No I wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Timotheo protested. &#x201c;I just didn&#x2019;t like not knowing who I am. I think I have the right to know that.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;You have no right. You are convicted of treason to the throne out of your own mouth,&#x201d; the Emperor said, satisfied. He looked at me on my high, uncomfortable bench. &#x201c;The law is the law,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Bear witness, Magid, that this man broke our Imperial decree.&#x201d;</p><p><br>I bowed. I couldn&#x2019;t bear to speak to him.</p><p><br>After that there was a great deal of palaver, with other dignitaries getting up in their grand silks and bearing witness too. It got like a pompous dance. I sat there considering when would be the best time to spirit young Timotheo away&#x2014;and I blame my jet-lagged state that I didn&#x2019;t do it there and then. He was looking stunned by this time. Six men had just paraded past him, passing sentence of death on him, each swinging the white lining of their bright pink cloaks towards him. It was like being sentenced by a bed of petunias. I couldn&#x2019;t take it seriously. I reckoned the best time to act was when they marched Timotheo back to his condemned cell. He had been brought in by a squad of �lite guards with a mage following for added assurance, and I assumed they would think no one could touch him through all that. I bided my time.</p><p><br>And missed out completely. The petunias retired. The Emperor said, quite casually, &#x201c;The sentence can be carried out now.&#x201d; He raised a hand glittering with rings. One of them must have been one of their beam weapons, miniaturized. Timotheo gasped quietly and fell over sideways on the floor with blood running out of his mouth.</p><p><br>It happened so quickly that I hoped it was a trick. I could not believe that, even in the Koryfonic Empire, an Emperor would not want his eldest son alive. While I was climbing down the varnished wooden steps to the centre of the court, I was still sure it was just a deception, to make the Emperor&#x2019;s enemies believe Timotheo was dead. But it was no trick. I touched Timotheo. He was still warm like a living person, but my fingers told me there was no soul there.</p><p><br>I left at once, from beside the corpse, to make my feelings plain.</p><p><br>I was thoroughly disgusted, with myself as well as the Emperor. As I made my way home, I told myself I had been stupid to expect compassion or even value for life in that place. And I had sufficient time to curse myself. Earth lies Naywards of the Empire, which makes the journey rather like going slowly uphill. I had to haul myself from lattice to lattice in the spaces between the worlds, and by the time I reached my house I not only hated the Empire, but also the stupid hampering robes it caused me to wear. I was just tearing the darn things off in my living room when the phone rang.</p><p><br>I wanted nothing more than to sit down with a fresh-brewed cup of coffee, before calling up the Senior Magid and lodging a formal complaint against the Emperor. I swore. I snatched up the phone.</p><p><br>&#x201c;<i>Now</i> what?&#x201d;</p><p><br>It was my elder brother Will &#x201c;Bad day?&#x201d; he said.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Very,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The Koryfonic Empire.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Then I believe you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Glad I don&#x2019;t have to look after that lot any longer.&#x201d; Will is a Magid too. &#x201c;And what I&#x2019;ve got to tell you won&#x2019;t make your day any better, I&#x2019;m afraid. I&#x2019;m ringing from Stan Churning&#x2019;s house. He&#x2019;s ill. He wants you here.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why does everything unpleasant always happen at once?&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. It just does,&#x201d; Will agreed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a deep secret, but it ought to be. I think Stan&#x2019;s dying, Rupert. He thinks so anyway; We tried to get hold of Si too, but he&#x2019;s out of touch. How soon can you get here?&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Half an hour,&#x201d; I said. Stan lives outside Newmarket. Weavers End, where I live, is just beyond Cambridge.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; said Will. &#x201c;Then I can stay with him until you get here.&#x201d; And keep him alive if necessary, Will meant. If Stan really was dying, there would be Magid business he had to hand on to me. &#x201c;See you soon,&#x201d; Will said and rang off.</p><p><br>I stayed in the house just long enough to make coffee and fax Senior Magid that I intended to complain about the Empire, to the Upper Room if necessary. Senior Magid lives several worlds Naywards and I normally make heavy weather of getting a fax through there. That day I did it in seconds. Five angry, trenchant sentences in no time at all. I was too busy thinking of Stan. I got in my car still thinking of him. Normally, getting into my car is a thing I pause and take pleasure in&#x2014;particularly if I have just been away for a while. It is a wholly beautiful car, the car I used to dream of owning as a boy. I usually pause to think how good it is that I can make the kind of money you need to own such a car. Not that day. I just got in and drove, swigging coffee from the Thermos, with my mind on Stan.</p><p><br>Stan had sponsored first Will, then our brother Simon, then me, into the Company of Magids. He had taught me most of what I know today. I wasn&#x2019;t sure that I knew what I&#x2019;d do without him. I kept praying that he, or Will, had made a mistake and that he was not dying after all. But one of the things about being a Magid is that you don&#x2019;t make that kind of mistake.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Damn!&#x201d; I said. I kept needing to blink. I didn&#x2019;t consciously see any of the roads I drove along until I was bumping up the weedy drive of Stan&#x2019;s bungalow.</p><p><br>A nasty bungalow. A blot on the landscape. It looked like a large cube of Stilton cheese dumped down in the flat heathland. We used to kid Stan about how ugly it was, but he always said he was quite happy in it. People who knew me, and particularly people who knew all three of us Venables brothers when we lived in Cambridge, used to wonder what we saw in a seedy little ex-jockey like Stan. They asked how we could bring ourselves to haunt his hideous house the way we did.</p><p><br>The answer is that all Magids lead double lives. We have to earn a living. Stan earned his advising sheiks and other rich men about racehorses. I design computer software myself, games mostly.</p><p><br>I parked my car beside Will&#x2019;s vehicle. At dusk, with the light behind it, it passes for a Land Rover. In broad daylight, as it was then, you look away and think you may have imagined things. I edged past it and Will opened the bottle-green front door of the bungalow to me.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Good timing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I have to go now and milk the goats. He&#x2019;s in the front room on the left.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;Is he&#x2014;?&#x201d; I said.</p><p><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Will. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve said goodbye. Shame Si can&#x2019;t be found. He&#x2019;s somewhere yonks Ayewards and not in touch with anyone I can contact. Stan&#x2019;s written him a letter. Let me know how things go, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; He went soberly past me and climbed into his queer vehicle.<br>I went on into the bungalow. Stan was lying, all five foot of him, stretched on top of a narrow bed by the window. His slightly bandy legs were in child-sized jeans and one of his socks had a thin place at the toe. At first sight, you would not have thought there was too much wrong with him, except that it was unlike him not to be wandering about doing something. But if you looked at his face, as I did almost straight away, you saw that it was strangely stretched over its bones, and that his eyes, under the high forehead left by his curly grey receding hair, were standing out like a cat&#x2019;s, luminous and feverish.</p><p><br>&#x201c;What kept you, Rupert?&#x201d; he joked, a bit gaspily. &#x201c;Will phoned you a good five minutes ago.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;The Koryfonic Empire,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I had to send a complaint to Senior Magid.&#x201d;</p><p><br>&#x201c;That lot!&#x201d; Stan gasped. &#x201c;She gets complaints about them from every Magid who goes near the place.

In sharing his stories, Atlas reveals the philosophy by which he lives.</p><p>Like Teddy Atlas -- inimitable, tough, honest, and wise -- this book inspires. It is about so much more than boxing. It is a story of overcoming hardships, of compassion for those in need, of tremendous personal integrity, and of personal and professional triumph.</p></p><p><p>Teddy Atlas works as a color analyst on <em>ESPN's Friday Night Fights</em> and was boxing commentator for NBC's coverage of the Olympic games in Sydney (2000) and Athens (2004). He is also founder and chairman of the Dr. Theodore A. Atlas Foundation, named for his father, which has raised and donated more than one million dollars to individuals and organizations in need.</p>Boxing trainer and ESPN commentator Atlas ruminates on fighting as a form of masculine psychotherapy, from his own youthful street brawling to his stints training a young Mike Tyson and heavyweight champ Michael Moorer. His theme is the male psyche's craving for paternal approval, evinced in his juvenile acting out against an emotionally distant dad and his ringside relationships with a succession of surrogate sons. With them, Atlas's mentoring toggles between fatherly tenderness ("I care about you. You're important to me") and tough-love harangues ("hit him in the fuckin' balls and become a fighter or you get on the next train and you get the fuck out of my life!"). He also becomes a spiritual guide to celebrity clients like Twyla Tharp, whom he lectures on the need to face one's fears, and Willem Dafoe, with whom he discusses the nature of truth. Atlas's exhaustively transcribed motivational sermons can be wearisome, and in his self-serving accounts of boxing industry intrigues he is always loyal and principled. But he and amanuensis Alson tell his story with plenty of atmospherics, Runyonesque characters and an illuminating focus on the boxer's internal battle.

A prayer book used during Jewish holidays, it was produced in the Middle Ages for the Jewish community of Worms in the German Rhineland. Though Worms was a vibrant center of Judaism in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and drew celebrated rabbis, little is known about the city's Jews in the later Middle Ages. In the pages of its famous book, Katrin Kogman-Appel discovers a portal into the life of this fourteenth-century community.</p><p>Medieval mahzorim were used only for special services in the synagogue and "belonged" to the whole congregation, so their visual imagery reflected the local cultural associations and beliefs. The Leipzig Mahzor pays homage to one of Worms's most illustrious scholars, Eleazar ben Judah. Its imagery reveals how his Ashkenazi Pietist worldview and involvement in mysticism shaped the community's religious practice. Kogman-Appel draws attention to the Mahzor's innovations, including its strategy for avoiding visual representation of God and its depiction of customs such as the washing of dishes before Passover, something less common in other mahzorim. In addition to decoding its iconography, Kogman-Appel approaches the manuscript as a ritual object that preserved a sense of identity and cohesion within a community facing a wide range of threats to its stability and security.</p></p><p>Katrin Kogman-Appel is Evelyn Metz Memorial Research Chair in Art, Department of the Arts, at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.&#x201c;In this meticulously researched book, Kogman-Appel casts new light on the religious concepts, ideas, rituals, and values in 14th-century Worms and in Ashkenaz in general. Her work provides us with historical insights about one of the important Jewish communities of medieval Europe about which we still know too little. We learn how the Jews of Worms 'saw' the Mahzor, how they saw themselves, and how they perceived their community in a time of decline.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Shmuel Shepkaru, The University of Oklahoma</b><br><br>&#x201c;Katrin Kogman-Appel has established herself as perhaps the foremost expositor of medieval illuminated Hebrew manuscripts today. Her treatment of the Leipzig Mahzor demonstrates once again that she is a scholar of formidable erudition who peels away the layers of these magnificent manuscripts to reveal the rich complexity of medieval society and the important role that visual culture plays in it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Adam S. Cohen, University of Toronto</b><br><br>&#x201c;An authoritative study of a stunning manuscript, Katrin Kogman-Appel's <i>A Mahzor from Worms</i> illuminates one of the great masterpieces of medieval Hebrew book painting. With great learning and historical imagination, Kogman-Appel unravels the Mahzor's intricate integration of ritual and pietistic practice in Worms, one of the great centers of medieval Ashkenazi culture.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>A Mahzor from Worms</i> offers a notably learned and thoughtful examination of a fascinating manuscript that has received surprisingly little scholarly attention. Conceptually sophisticated and thoroughly interdisciplinary, it convincingly reads the Mahzor as a kind of self-portrait created by and for the Worms Jewish community. The sensitive analysis reveals a still vibrant but increasingly pressured community struggling to honor sometimes-conflicting traditions and reconcile a proud heritage with contemporary needs. It is a significant contribution to cultural history as well as art history and Judaic Studies.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sara Lipton, State University of New York at Stony Brook</b></p><h2>Tamales: Fast and Delicious Mexican Meals [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>A cookbook for making delicious, inventive, and fast tamales using time-saving tips and tricks that simplify the prep-intensive traditional process.</b> <br><br>Tamales are a Mexican favorite, beloved year-round as well as at Christmas, when the whole family traditionally pitches in with the work of tamale preparation and assembly. Thanks to renowned <i>tamalera</i> Alice Guadalupe Tapp, it&#x2019;s now possible to enjoy these delicious treats with a lot less labor. Tapp has worked her tamale magic to turn the classic process on its head by paring it down to three to four steps that can be done in as little as forty-five minutes using handy tips, products, and tools. All sixty dishes in the book are naturally gluten free, and include both classic tamale recipes&#x2014;such as Chicken Mole, Sirloin Beef, and Fresh Poblano and Potato tamales&#x2014;and novel recipes such as Chorizo and Egg, Oxtail, and Baked Fig tamales. With this book, tamales are fast and easy enough to enjoy every day, and delicious enough to serve at any celebration.</p><p>When ALICE GUADALUPE TAPP was only seven years old, she began helping her grandmother make tamales to sell after Sunday mass. Now Alice is co-owner (with her daughter, Tamara) of Tamara's Tamales in Marina Del Rey, California. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Tamales 101</i>.I love tamales. I love making them, and I love to create new varieties. I love making the masa and the fillings, and I love the process of assembling them. Most of all, I love to serve them to my family and friends and experience the satisfaction they get when tasting all the new and different flavors. They have been my ever-so-eager tamale-tasting guinea pigs for many years.&nbsp;<br><br> Shortly after my first book, <i>Tamales 101</i>, was published, I began teaching tamale-cooking classes at various culinary schools on the West Coast. I enjoyed teaching the process and knew the classes would increase the visibility of my book. I quickly realized that, for most students, making traditional tamales was too prep-intensive and time-consuming. Many of the students came away from those classes saying they would most likely not make the tamales at home because they were &#x201c;too much work&#x201d; and that they would be perfectly happy to purchase them at our tamale shop. This proved to be an excellent vehicle to promote my business; however, I truly want to keep the tamale-making tradition alive and encourage my students to make their own&#x2014;I strongly believe the best tamales come from our own kitchens.&nbsp;<br> To help preserve this tradition, I began trying to come up with new methods to simplify the process and make it easier and more appealing for home cooks. <br><br> It took me several years of research and trial and error, but the idea to make simple and great-tasting tamales became a mission of sorts.&nbsp;<br><br> My memories of cooking with my mother as a child helped me tremendously. In addition to teaching me everything she knew about tamale making, she taught me how to use time-saving techniques and products&#x2014;such as ready-made moles and canned roasted chiles&#x2014;to make recipes faster and easier, without compromising taste, richness, or satisfaction in the end result.&nbsp;<br><br> In addition to experimenting with shortening the process, which can often include up to ten steps, I experimented with different tamale styles. Tamales can be wrapped and assembled in a variety of ways, from quick and easy corundas, where the filling and masa are mixed together, to &#x201c;inside-out&#x201d; tamales, where the fillings are served on top or on the side of plain, unfilled tamales called <i>tontos</i>. Both of these styles can be assembled in only two or three steps. And if you can shorten the process and change up the style, who says you can&#x2019;t experiment with fillings, too? If you like a particular food, it will probably work in or on a tamale or corunda.&nbsp;<br><br> In today&#x2019;s world, we are so often busy and pushed for time, and the idea of setting aside one or two days to make tamales is saved for special occasions, such as Christmas, when women in Mexico traditionally gather to make traditional tamales in enormous quantities. But we should also be able to enjoy tamales on a weeknight! All of the recipes in this book shorten the process to less than an hour, once the fillings are prepared (many of which can be made well in advance), making tamales a more accessible, everyday menu item. If you would like to try your hand at tamale making but have found it to be too daunting a task, this book is especially for you.&nbsp;<br><br> I grew up in a kitchen, learning to cook mainly from my mother, an artist who dreamed of becoming an opera singer. Like many women of her generation, she married and had children instead. All of her artistic ability then went into cooking and homemaking. We were a culinary family, though, and my grandfather, grandmother, and aunts also helped teach me to cook.&nbsp;<br><br>All of my first books were cookbooks, and I still have my mother&#x2019;s torn, stained, falling-apart copy of <i>The Good Housekeeping Cookbook</i>. I&#x2019;ve patched and taped it countless times over the years. I have old, brown, and stained small pieces of paper and index cards that are inscribed with recipes, mostly the favorites my grandmother, mother, and mother-in-law used. I began collecting recipes in my late teens. I asked everyone and anyone who had a good recipe to share it. For many years I would ask for the exact recipe, but eventually I was able to just get the list of ingredients and figure it out myself.&nbsp;<br><br> With an abundance of experience from my career in the entertainment business and establishing my own successful businesses, I wanted to create a business involving my love of tamales. My daughter, Tamara, and I opened our tamale specialty shop, Tamara&#x2019;s Tamales, in the Marina del Rey area of Los Angeles. We have had continued success for nineteen years. Tamara now runs the shop on a daily basis and I help with a few of the details. When asked what I attribute our success to, I usually reply that our product is good, we always put the financial well-being of the business first, and Tamara and I work well together&#x2014;we love and respect each other and are grateful for our shared creative process. Also, the fact that we&#x2019;ve always loved having our tamale business and always loved our customers doesn&#x2019;t hurt! Along the way, the success of Tamara&#x2019;s Tamales has lead to a bunch of other fun and rewarding opportunities, such as teaching tamale-making classes at culinary schools, earning top honors at tamale contests, recognition from many well-known chefs, and being able to make donations of tamales to nonprofits and benefits.&nbsp;<br>------------------------------------------------<br><br>Chicken Mole Poblano Tamales<br> This is an easy, delicious version of chicken with Oaxacan mole sauce. The peanut butter punches it up a bit, a trick my mother taught me. She used canned, powdered mole poblano that called only for chicken broth to be added, which is what I do, too. I use Do�a Maria mole poblano, a paste product that comes in small glass jars. Makes 18 tamales<br><br> 1 (8.5-ounce) jar prepared mole or mole poblano<br> 2 tablespoons peanut butter<br> 3 cups chicken stock, or 3 cups water mixed with 3 tablespoons good granulated chicken bouillon<br> 3 cups cubed chicken&nbsp;<br> 41/2 cups Basic Fresh Masa (page 21)<br> Open the jar of mole and pour the thin layer of oil off the top of the paste into a medium saucepan. Heat the oil over medium heat and add the peanut butter. Fry the peanut butter for a couple of minutes, stirring frequently so it doesn&#x2019;t burn. Add the contents of the jar (you&#x2019;ll need a knife or fork to remove it, because it is quite dry and solid). Immediately add the chicken stock and, using a whisk, break down all the mole lumps. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, whisking frequently, until a very smooth sauce forms. <br><br>Pour into a medium bowl and set aside to cool.&nbsp;When the sauce is cool, add the chicken and stir until the chicken is well distributed into the sauce.<br><br> Assemble the tamales (see pages 5-6), using 1/4 cup masa and 1/4 cup chicken mole filling per tamale. Transfer to a steamer and steam for 55 minutes.<br><br> <i>Note: </i>If you are gluten free, check any prepared mole sauce for thickening agents and use only those made with corn, banana, or rice.<br></p><h2>The National Geographic Society: 100 Years of Adventure and Discovery</h2><p>Documenting the entire history of the Society and its renowned magazine, a volume prepared with full access to the Society&#39;s archives includes great adventures, discoveries, first-person narratives, and events highlighted by some of Geographic&#39;s best photographs, maps, and illustrations.</p><p>C.D.B.

The volume pinpoints the intersections of these divergent witnesses to the modern condition of doubt, the no-man's-land between traditional religion and modern secular culture. </p><p> Scholem, the devoted Zionist and master historian of Jewish mysticism, and Benjamin, the Marxist cultural critic, dedicated much of their thought and correspondence to Kafka, the explorer in fiction of radical alienation. Kafka's sense of spiritual complexities was an inspiration to both thinkers in their resistance to the murderous simplification of totalitarian ideology. In <i>Necessary Angels</i> Alter uncovers a moment when the future of modernism is revealed in its preoccupation with the past. The angel of the title is first Kafka's: on June 25, 1914, the writer recorded in his diary a dream vision of an angel that turned into the painted wooden figurehead of a ship. In 1940, at the end of his life, Walter Benjamin devoted the ninth of his <i>Theses on the Philosophy of History</i> to a meditation on an angel by the artist Paul Klee, first quoting a poem he had written on that painting. In Benjamin's vision, the figure from Klee becomes an angel of history, sucked into the future by the storm of progress, his face looking back to Eden. Benjamin bequeathed the Klee oil painting to Scholem; it hung in the living room of Scholem's home on Abarbanel Street in Jerusalem until 1989, when his widow placed it in the Israel Museum. </p><p> Alter's focus on the epiphanic force of memory on these three great modernists shows with sometimes startling, sometimes prophetic clarity that a complete break with tradition is not essential to modernism. <i>Necessary Angels</i> itself continues the necessary discovery of the future in the past. </p></p><p>Robert Alter is Professor of Hebrew and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley.

Moments later, two bodies are found in a nearby church, each with a gruesome calling card from the killer. Thus begins David Hewson's elegant and electrifying new novel. Set amidst a bizarre killing spree in modern Rome, it is a bewitching blend of history and drama, sensuality and suspense.<br><br>As the August heat takes Rome in its fiery grip, the news of two brutal murders holds the city in thrall. And as the media gathers and Vatican officials close ranks, a young detective is sent to the forefront of the case. Nic Costa is the son of an infamous Italian Communist, a connoisseur of Caravaggio , and a cop who barely looks his 27 years of age. Thrust into the heart of a killing spree that will rattle his city down to its ancient bones, Nic meets a woman who will soon dominate both his consciousness and his investigation. <br><br>A cool, beautiful professor of early Christianity, Sara Farnese was in the Vatican library on that fateful day, a witness to her colleague's strange outburst and death. But her role will become even more puzzling as more bodies are found: Each victim killed in a gory tableau of Christian martyrdom. And each victim had intimately known Sara, whose silence Costa cannot quite crack and whose carnal history becomes more lurid and unfathomable with every revelation. <br><br>Soon, a nightmarish chase is implicating politicians and priests -- while at the heart of the matter remains the woman Costa is both investigating and guarding. Wanting to believe in Sara's innocence, Nic still cannot turn his eyes from the truths he is uncovering. Even as the secrets of a woman, a killer and a city begin to unravel...with devastating consequences.<br><br>A beguiling mystery, a dazzling treat for the senses, and a fascinating tour of the streets and alleyways of Rome, Nic Costa's relentlessly suspenseful debut is a masterpiece of suspense fiction.?David Hewson was born in Yorkshire in 1953. He worked as staff writer on THE TIMES from 1978, and has written five novels, as well as several travel books. He is now a weekly columnist for the SUNDAY TIMES. His second novel in the Nic Costa series will be THE VILLA OF MYSTERIES, and will be published in April 2004.

He is also eccentric, reclusive, confined to a wheelchair, and looking for a way to die. Nate O&#39;Riley is a high-octane Washington litigator who&#39;s lived too hard, too fast, for too long. Emerging from his fourth stay in rehab, he knows returning to the real world is always difficult, but this time it&#39;s going to be murder. Rachel Lane is a young woman who chose to give her life to God, who walked away from the modern world with all its strivings and trappings and encumbrances, and went to live and work with a primitive tribe of Indians in the deepest jungles of Brazil. In a story that mixes legal suspense with a remarkable adventure, their lives are forever altered by the startling secret of &#34;The Testament&#34;.</p><p>Troy Phelan, a 78-year-old eccentric and the 10th-richest man in America, is about to read his last will and testament, divvying up an estate worth $11 billion. Phelan's three ex-wives, their grasping spawn, a legion of lawyers, several psychiatrists, and a plethora of sound technicians wait breathlessly, all eyes glued to digital monitors as they watch the old man read his verdict. But Phelan shocks everyone with a bizarre, last-gasp attempt to redistribute the spoils, setting in motion a legal morality tale of a contested will, sin, and redemption.<p> Our hero, Nate O'Riley--a washed-up, alcoholic litigator with two ruined marriages in his wake and the IRS on his tail--is dispatched to the Brazilian wetlands in search of a mysterious heir named in the will. After a harrowing trip upriver to a remote settlement in the Pantanal, he encounters Rachel Lane, a pure-hearted missionary living with an indigenous tribe and carrying out "God's work." Rachel's grave dedication and kindness impress the jaded lawyer, so much that a nasty bout of dengue fever leads him to a vision that could change his life.</p><p> Back in the States, the legal proceedings drag on and Grisham has a high time with Phelan's money-hungry descendents, a regrettable bunch who squandered millions, married strippers, got druggy, and befriended the Mob. The youngest son, Ramble, is a multi-pierced, tattoo-covered malcontent with big dreams for his rock band, the Demon Monkeys. Will Nate get straight with Rachel's aid? Do the greedy heirs get theirs? What's the real legacy of a lifetime's work? <i>The Testament</i> is classic Grisham: a down-and-out lawyer, a lot of money, an action-packed pursuit, and the highest issues at stake.

They all inhabit this new, comprehensive collection of strange and fantastic beasts. In excerpts spanning millennia and reflecting the development of the Western imagination itself, we encounter old favorites like the dragon, unicorn, phoenix, griffin, and mermaid, as well as a host of other bizarre creatures.<br> Comprising hundreds of well-known and obscure primary sources arranged chronologically by writer, <em>The Book of Fabulous Beasts</em> traces the development of imaginary animals as they appear and reappear in literary accounts from the Babylonian epic of creation to modern fantasy. From Herodotus to medieval bestiaries and travelers's tales, and from Renaissance heraldry, alchemy, and natural histories to the fantasy fiction of Tolkien, the author shows how these resilient beasts--once believed to be real--have transformed and regenereated through time, surviving even the Age of Reason that banished them to the realm of the "fabulous." With an extensive general introduction, glossary of animals, bibliography, index, and more than a hundred illustrations from a Babylonian cylinder seal of a god battling a dragon to James Thurber's drawing of a unicorn in a modern garden, this volume will be the standard reference for years to come. <br> <em>The Book of Fabulous Beasts</em> is the rare combination of an exhaustive source book and a delightful read. Readers can browse excerpts, trace one particular creature as it develops through time and translation, or read this epic story straight through, discovering along the way as much about the history and dreams of the human creature as about the fanciful animals on every page.</p><p><br><strong>Joseph Nigg</strong> is the author of the award-winning <em>Book of Gryphons, A Guide to the Imaginary Birds of the World</em>, and <em>Wonder Beasts: Tales and Lore of the Phoenix, the Griffin, the Unicorn and the Dragon.</em><br>Basilisks, griffins, and mermaids inhabit this ambitious collection of representative writings about mythical creatures that, according to the original context, may or may not exist. Nigg, the author of several books on imaginary animals, has arranged this source book chronologically and divided it into four parts roughly corresponding to the classical, medieval, Renaissance, and modern periods of Western history, each prefaced by a brief introduction. From Homer's sirens to James Thurber's unicorn, over 100 writers, both familiar and obscure, contribute to the literary histories of beasts. Although similar to Malcolm South's Mythical and Fabulous Creatures (LJ 6/15/87), Nigg's book is more comprehensive, focusing on primary sources?poems, travelers' tales, the Bible, and fiction?rather than on scholarly essays. The glossary, index, and cross references to particular beasts add to the accessibility of this recommended work.?Cathy Sabol, Northern Virginia Community Coll., Manassas<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Stoned Images</h2><p>Seventy-seven full-color photographs of Balinese stone sculptures and carvings.

Drawing on years of research and documentation, including Venture Smith's rare personal autobiography, Saint and Krimsky vividly recount the extraordinary challenges he overcame. They cast a rare light on what it was like to be an African American in the north during the Colonial era.

Mitchel Memorial Lecture Series)</h2><p><p>In the 5th century BCE, Herodotus wrote the first known Western history to build on the tradition of Homeric storytelling, basing his text on empirical observations and arranging them systematically. <i>Herodotus and the Question Why</i> offers a comprehensive examination of the methods behind the <i>Histories</i> and the challenge of documenting human experiences, from the Persian Wars to cultural traditions.</p><p>In lively, accessible prose, Christopher Pelling explores such elements as reconstructing the mentalities of storyteller and audience alike; distinctions between the human and the divine; and the evolving concepts of freedom, democracy, and individualism. Pelling traces the similarities between Herodotus's approach to physical phenomena (Why does the Nile flood?) and to landmark events (Why did Xerxes invade Greece? And why did the Greeks win?), delivering a fascinating look at the explanatory process itself. The cultural forces that shaped Herodotus's thinking left a lasting legacy for us, making <i>Herodotus and the Question Why</i> especially relevant as we try to record and narrate the stories of our time and to fully understand them.</p></p><p>Christopher Pelling was Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford University from 2003 to 2015 and is now an Honorary Fellow of University College; he is also a Fellow of the British Academy and a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales.

His numerous previous books include Literary Texts and the Greek Historian and Plutarch and History. Most recently, he coauthored Twelve Voices from Greece and Rome: Ancient Ideas for Modern Times and a commentary on Herodotus 6.&#34;This is a fantastic book: fluently organized, written in a straightforward and friendly tone, and massively supported by research, as the ample and up-to-date bibliography evinces. Particularly interesting and admirable is the establishment of a vocabulary for describing Herodotus&#39;s arguments that is won from his texts and those of his contemporaries and therefore never seems imposed or anachronistic. I can think of no volume that is the equivalent of this one.&#34; (Edith Foster, University of Queensland, author of Thucydides, Pericles, and Periclean Imperialism)</p><h2>Mademoiselle de Maupin</h2><p>Used.

Smith recounts&#x2014;in delicious detail&#x2014;the creation of contemporary American cuisine. The diet of the modern American wasn't always as corporate, conglomerated, and corn-rich as it is today, and the style of American cooking, along with the ingredients that compose it, has never been fixed. With a cast of characters including bold inventors, savvy restaurateurs, ruthless advertisers, mad scientists, adventurous entrepreneurs, celebrity chefs, and relentless health nuts, Smith pins down the truly crackerjack history behind the way America eats.<br><br>Smith's story opens with early America, an agriculturally independent nation where most citizens grew and consumed their own food. Over the next two hundred years, however, Americans would cultivate an entirely different approach to crops and consumption. Advances in food processing, transportation, regulation, nutrition, and science introduced highly complex and mechanized methods of production. The proliferation of cookbooks, cooking shows, and professionally designed kitchens made meals more commercially, politically, and culturally potent. To better understand these trends, Smith delves deeply and humorously into their creation. Ultimately he shows how, by revisiting this history, we can reclaim the independent, locally sustainable roots of American food.</p><p>The diet of the modern American wasn&#39;t always as corporate, conglomerated, and corn-rich as it is today, and the style of American cooking, along with the ingredients that compose it, has never been fixed.

While she spends her days tending to the cattle, her heart lies with her beloved gray mare. When Lara goes to the highlands to set the cattle out to graze, she finds the mare in the process of a difficult birth. Lara vows to take care of the foal as a dying promise to the gray mare, and with the help of a childless milk-cow, she cares for the spindly-legged filly. But just when she is confident that the foal can survive, a rival clan captures them both, and throws Lara's life into turmoil. When the filly is eventually given to a titled baron in the castle town of Athenry, Lara, determined to stay with the horse no matter what, goes along. Together, she and her beloved horse face seemingly insurmountable challenges, but all along Lara keeps two things in mind. One day, she will manage to flee, and will set off in search of the family that she was taken from. And she will not leave without her silver mare.<br><br></p><p>Kathleen Duey is the author of numerous books for young readers.Gr. 4-6. This book completes the Hoofbeats historical fiction quartet that began with <i>Lara and the Gray Mare</i> (2005), <i>Lara and the Moon-colored Filly</i> (2005), and <i>Lara at Athenry Castle</i> (2005). The concluding volume of this episodic story follows Lara and her horse after she leaves Athenry Castle in disguise. When she meets her father on the road and he takes her home, her story seems to have come full circle. But Lara is no longer the girl she was and, in the end, she chooses her own future.

A sure attraction for young readers with an interest in horses, this has much more to offer: swift, sure character portrayals, a convincing medieval Irish setting, and a continuing story of high adventure. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Originally found within Irving&#x2019;s ninth novel, <i>A Widow for One Year</i>, this atmospheric tale has been brought to life by Tatjana Hauptmann&#x2019;s beautifully muted illustrations.<br><br>Includes an introduction by the author.</p><p>In John Irving's ninth novel <i>A Widow for One Year</i>, a creepy children's book author named Ted Cole writes a bedtime story about things that go bump in the night. That odd, gently comical tale is brought to life here with Tatjana Hauptmann's shadowy, moonlit pencil illustrations. Young Tom wakes up in the middle of the night to an unusual sound, but his two-year-old brother Tim does not. When his fathers asks what it sounded like, Tom reveals a number of silly and scary options: "like a monster with no arms and no legs," or "a dog trying to open a door," or "a ghost dropping stolen peanuts"--"a sound like someone trying not to make a sound," in fact. The illustrations--with a smattering of wordless spreads--show the pajama-clad Tom wandering alone through a big empty house as bulges in the wall and long shadows hint at unseen horrors. In the end, the father tells his boys that the sound is just a mouse in the wall. Tom is immensely relieved, but baby Tim screams because he doesn't know what a mouse is, and stays up all night to ward off the furry, mysterious thing. Not too scary, nor too comforting, Irving's picture-book debut imaginatively captures that late-night world where everything looks and sounds a little like a monster.

His Diary is one of the principal sources for many aspects of the history of its period. In spite of its significance, all previous editions were inadequately edited and suffered from a number of omissions until Robert Latham and William Matthews went back to the 300-year-old original manuscript and deciphered each passage and phrase, no matter how obscure or indiscreet.<br><br>The <i>Diary</i> deals with some of the most dramatic events in English history. Pepys witnessed the London Fire, the Great Plague, the Restoration of Charles II, and the Dutch Wars. He was a patron of the arts, having himself composed many delightful songs and participated in the artistic life of London. His flair for gossip and detail reveals a portrait of the times that rivals the most swashbuckling and romantic historical novels. In none of the earlier versions was there a reliable, full text, with commentary and notation with any claim to completeness. This edition, first published in 1970, is the first in which the entire diary is printed with systematic comment. This is the only complete edition available; it is as close to Pepys&#x2019;s original as possible.</p><p><b>Robert Latham </b>was Pepys Librarian at Magdalene College, Cambridge. In addition to editing the eleven volumes of <i>The Diary of Samuel Pepys</i>, he was the editor of the acclaimed <i>Shorter Pepys</i> (1985) and <i>A Pepys Anthology</i> (1988), both published by University of California Press. <b>William Matthews</b> was Professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles.&#34;[Pepys] was not only Charles II&#39;s chief naval administrator, but a keen amateur of learning and an indefatigable enthusiast of politics, music, theater, women, life. He sets down his daily experience with a journalist&#39;s eye for detail, something of a novelist&#39;s sensitivity and, since he is writing for himself, a delightful frankness.&#34;--&#34;Publishers Weekly</p><h2>Culture, Man, and Nature;: An Introduction to General Anthropology</h2><p>Culture, Man, And Nature An Introduction To General Anthropology By: Marvin Harris 1971 ISBN 0-690-23034-6 Library Of Congress Catalog Card Number 78-146065.

Now, almost one hundred years later, this definitive account offers a unique look at the Wright Brothers' achievement, and at the many experiments that led up to their momentous ride.</p><p>Revealing the brothers' youthful interest in technology and flight, the authors recount the trials and errors of other would-be aviators, and explain how the race to be the first man aloft became an international obsession. Readers will learn how <em>The Flyer</em> -- the Wright Brothers' original plane -- was built, and how its indefatigable inventors solved the challenges that stumped their predecessors. And finally there is the historic flight itself -- what went wrong and what, amazingly, went right -- and the enormous impact the Wright Brothers had on their own and future generations. Written in engaging, accessible prose and, featuring more than 200 photographs and illustrations, <em>On Great White Wings</em> will delight anyone interested in the history of flight and in the fantastic story behind the twentieth century's most important achievement.</p></p><p><strong>Fred E. C. Culick</strong> is a leading expert in aeronautics and astronautics and is currently Richard L. and Dorothy M. Hayman Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. He has published widely, and his articles have appeared in <em>Scientific American</em> and other magazines. He helped create a full-scale replica of the Wright Flyer for use in wind-tunnel testing and is now at work on a new replica that he will pilot on the hundredth anniversary of the first flight in 2003. He lives in Pasadena, California.<br><br> <strong>Spencer Dunmore</strong> is the author of many books on aviation, including <em>Bomb Run</em>, <em>Squadron</em>, <em>Final Approach</em>, and <em>Reap the Whirlwind</em>, a history of the Canadian Air Force in World War II, co-written with William Carter. He has also written the naval history <em>In Great Waters</em>, and collaborated with Dr. Robert Ballard on <em>Exploring the Lusitania</em>. He lives in Burlington, Ontario.Capitalizing on the approaching centenary of the Wright <i>Flyer</i>, at least one biographer (James Tobin) is hard at work on the lives of the Wright brothers, and author Culick is laboring to build a replica of that first plane. His project gets a sidebar in this picture book, which otherwise is a showcase of the Wrights' victory in the intense competition to develop a heavier-than-air flying machine. Culick notes that the precise technical characteristics of <i>The Flyer</i> have baffled aeronautical engineers, a puzzle his replica hopes to solve; however, the technical details discussed, such as the chord of the wing, are of less interest to most readers than Wilbur and Orville Wright's legendary story, culminating in the brief but epochal first flight in 1903. Culick and Dunmore stolidly recount the mechanical innovations that contributed to that success and continue the tale into the less triumphant sequel of patent battles and the rapid obsolescence of their basic and very accident-prone design. This generously illustrated title no doubt augurs a wave of coming books on the Wright brothers. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

These compelling first-person accounts take us back to one of the most tumultuous periods in our nation&#x2019;s history&#x2015;to the early days of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), the Albany Freedom Ride, voter registration drives and lunch counter sit-ins, Freedom Summer, the 1964 Democratic Convention, and the rise of Black Power and the women&#x2019;s movement. The book delves into the hearts of the women to ask searching questions. Why did they, of all the white women growing up in their hometowns, cross the color line in the days of segregation and join the Southern Freedom Movement? What did they see, do, think, and feel in those uncertain but hopeful days?

We were moved to our radical activities in various ways: by Marxism, Christian existentialism, and immigrant folk wisdom; by our grandmothers and the Constitution; by Thoreau and Dumas; by living on a kibbutz; by African freedom fighters; and by a Deep South upbringing. . . . Our book is about girls growing up in a revolutionary time and place. It is about love and politics and the transcendence of racial barriers. We offer this work to enrich the chronicle of a social movement that forever changed the country and our lives. </p><p>From the Foreword by Barbara Ransby: </p><p>These first-person accounts by white women activists represent a critical voice, yet one that has not been often heard. . . . This book breaks that silence. . . . <i>Deep in Our Hearts</i> gives us another lens through which to view the politics of race and gender in the civil rights movement [and] probes the themes of growth, discovery, friendship, and courage. . . . The real gift of these stories is a more optimistic legacy for a new generation of blacks and whites as they navigate the ever-volatile path of racial relations into the twenty-first century and, hopefully, take up the challenge that 1960s activists did of trying to make the world a better and more humane place.</p></p><h2>The Brihadaranyaka Upanisad,</h2><p>ii + 728 pages, Sanskrit writing followed by the mystic meaning according to numerology and the English translation of the passage</p><p>Text: English</p><h2>The German Army on Vimy Ridge 1914 - 1917</h2><p>The book starts with on the capture of Vimy Ridge and the nearly spur of Notre Dame de Lorette in October 1914. <br><br>The major battles of spring and autumn 1915 is described as is the twelve month period from late autumn 1915 when British forces occupied the lines on the western Ridge.

But <i>Black Manhattan</i> is by no means simply history; It illuminates Johnson and his contributions to both black literature and black organizations; it provides us with an intimate account of the black theatrical and musical world of which Johnson had been a part; and it raises searching questions about the black people's struggle to find their identity. <i>Black Manhattan</i> remains one of the essential books on the black American experience, losing none of its resonance and value after many decades.</p><p><b>James Weldon Johnson (1871&#x2013;1938) </b>is recognized alongside W.E.B.

You have an eight-story hotel to haunt. There&#x2019;s a complete apartment reserved for your personal use. Why don&#x2019;t you stay there? It&#x2019;s the nicest one in the whole building.&#x201d; The management had sealed off a large apartment because it was way too haunted for living guests to put up with. The hope was that if they gave the ghosts their own space they wouldn&#x2019;t haunt the rest of the hotel so much. Some hope.</p><p>&#x201c;We get bored,&#x201d; Rudolph Valentino said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing but ghosts there.&#x201d; &#x201c;So you crowd in here so you can bore me, and stink up my room,&#x201d; I said. I was mad. I really liked most of the ghosts, but a woman is entitled to some privacy. Grumbling and mumbling, the ghosts climbed out my bedroom window, made their way along the ledge, and climbed into the window of the apartment that had belonged to Valentino in 1927. I had been in the apartment lots of times. Like the ghosts, I had to climb out my window and go along the narrow ledge to get in, which was a little scary to do if you weren&#x2019;t already dead.</p><p>The Hermione is not a regular hotel in the sense that people check in for a couple of nights or a week. It&#x2019;s all apartments, some tiny and some quite large. People live in it for months at a stretch, or all the time. It was quite the fancy address when my father first came to Hollywood in the days of the silent movies.</p><p>You can see what a deluxe sort of place it was. It has architecture all over it. There are rough plaster walls, old-fashioned light fixtures made of hammered iron, fancy tile floors, and dark, heavy woodwork with carvings and decorations on it. There are tapestries that hang from iron things that look like spears, and a couple of suits of armor standing around. It looks like a movie set. It&#x2019;s a combination of old Spanish California and the Middle Ages, with some Arabian Nights thrown in.</p><p>I have lived in the Hermione all my life. I know the old hotel from top to bottom. I have been in all of the apartments, the basement, the laundry, and the restaurant that&#x2019;s been closed for years, and I know about the deserted tennis courts and the second, unused, and hidden swimming pool where the enormous turtle lives. I know things about the hotel that Mr. Glanvill, the manager, does not know. Chase, my favorite ghost, was the one who showed me where to find the master key someone had mislaid a long time ago. It opens every door in the place except the one to Valentino&#x2019;s apartment where all the ghosts hang out, because the door lock is rusted solid. Chase is not the ghost of a person. She is the ghost of a black bunny rabbit. She has been sort of my own personal ghost since I was a baby. We are able to talk, which is something you can&#x2019;t do with a living bunny. Chase changes size. Usually, she is bunny-size, but I have seen her get to be as large as a German shepherd dog.</p><p>Rudolph Valentino is the ghost most people would know about, because he was a big movie star in the 1920s&#x2014;but the oldest ghost, and the one who should be most famous, really, is La Brea Woman. Valentino doesn&#x2019;t compare to La Brea Woman for being distinguished. She is the only human whose bones have been pulled out of the La Brea Tar Pits. She lived about nine thousand years ago. She is the oldest human ever found in Southern California. Plus, she was murdered&#x2014;someone knocked her on the head with a rock. We are all proud of La Brea Woman. And she&#x2019;s a nice ghost. She&#x2019;s shorter than I am, in her early twenties, and always has her hair in curlers and wears sunglasses with pink frames and fuzzy pink slippers. She is friendly and cheerful, and talks a blue streak in some ancient dialect that hasn&#x2019;t been heard on earth in thousands of years.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know exactly how many ghosts live in the Hermione&#x2014;at least a dozen, maybe more. Not all of them like to communicate&#x2014;they just haunt, appear and disappear, walk the corridors&#x2014;some of them moan, or cry, or make ghostly laughter. Chase is the only ghost with whom I can have a conversation. Valentino will exchange a few words with me&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s just his polite nature. Alsso, he may be nice to me because he knew my father in the old days.</p></p><h2>Pearls Before Swine: An Albert Campion Mystery</h2><p>It was most unfortunate that Edna, Dowager Marchioness of Carados, found a strange woman in her son&#39;s bed the night before his wedding--it was even more unfortunate that the woman was dead, and that Edna decided to take the body to Albert Campion.

She sold her first story at age 8 and published her first novel before turning 20. She married the artist, journalist and editor Philip Youngman Carter in 1927. In 1928 Allingham published her first detective story,&nbsp;<i>The White Cottage Mystery</i>, and the following year, in&nbsp;<i>The Crime at Black Dudley</i>, she introduced the detective who was to become the hallmark of her sophisticated crime novels and murder mysteries -- Albert Campion. Famous for her London thrillers, such as&nbsp;<i>Hide My Eyes&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Tiger in the Smoke</i>, Margery Allingham has been compared to Dickens in her evocation of the city's shady underworld. Acclaimed by crime novelists such as P.D. James, Allingham is counted alongside Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie and Gladys Mitchell as a pre-eminent Golden Age crime writer.

We meet the dapper son-in-law of an Australian wine baron who commissions the coat&#x2019;s creation, and we come to know John Cutler, one of the top bespoke tailors in the world, who works his magic with scissors and thread out of his Sydney shop, redolent of cedar and English wool.<br> &nbsp;<br> Featuring a cast of offbeat, obsessed, and wildly entertaining characters, <i>The Coat Route</i> presents a rich tapestry of local masters, individual artisans, and family-owned companies that have stood against the tide of mass consumerism. As Noonan comes to realize, these craftsmen, some of whom find themselves on the brink of retirement with no obvious successors, have increasing reason to believe that their way is the best way&#x2014;best for their customers, best for the environment, and best for the quality of life of all involved. <i>The Coat Route </i>is a love song to things of lasting value.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Coat Route</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br>&#x201c;A spirited tour of fashion history . . . <i>The Coat Route</i> compels us to remember that behind every garment is a deep history and a pair of human hands&#x2014;whether those hands stitched the dress&#x2019;s hem or pulled a lever that stringed together that $30 must-have jacket.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Delightful . . . <i>The Coat Route</i> celebrates those who work with their hands, creating something beautiful and lasting.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Seattle Times</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[Meg Lukens Noonan&#x2019;s] exploration of the business of fashion is fascinating and thorough, and her examination of bespoke goods redefines the words luxury and obsession.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;The Daily Beast</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Traditions of bespoke tailoring (and other related crafts) are skirting the edge of extinction.

She lives in New Hampshire.Chapter 1<br><br> I hold that gentleman to be the best-�dressed whose dress no one observes.<br><br> Anthony Trollope<br><br> On a rare cloudless October morning in London&#x2019;s West End, I am in a cab, stuck in traffic. The problem is not the standard transit strike or a procession of minor royals or a road race for charity. The holdup today is due to sheep. By decree of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, this is British Wool Week, and, to celebrate, Savile Row is hosting a Field Day. The block has been closed to vehicles and turned into a barnyard, complete with a thousand meters of clipped sod, a rough-�hewn barn, and two flocks of no doubt puzzled sheep.<br><br> When I finally rush into the press reception at Sartoria, the restaurant that is serving as Field Day Central, the welcoming speeches are already under way. I find a spot to stand in the back of the room, elbow to elbow with a sea of men in good wool suits. Most are in dark solids or subtle chalk stripes, but a few have broken out mossy plaids with matching flat caps&#x2014;�the kind of foggy-�heath apparel that cries out to be accessorized with hounds. One after another, the speakers sing the praises of wool, farmers, and Prince Charles, who is himself an enthusiastic keeper of sheep.<br><br> Ten months had passed since textile executives, designers, carpet makers, and retailers sat on folding chairs in a frigid two-�hundred-�year-�old beamed barn in Cambridgeshire to hear the prince outline his five-�year Campaign for Wool, aimed at reviving the Commonwealth&#x2019;s moribund wool business. Charles had kept his double-�breasted camel overcoat on as he stood in front of a small podium, backed by bales of hay and a red wagon full of raw wool, and bemoaned the state of the fiber that for centuries had been the glorious engine of England&#x2019;s economy. The cost of shearing sheep, he said, was higher than the price being paid for wool. Demand had fallen, and farmers were reducing or eliminating their flocks.<br><br> &#x201c;The future for this most wonderful fiber is looking very bleak indeed,&#x201d; said the prince, who, following his comments, mingled for a time with attendees but left before the Mutton Renaissance Club served its signature mutton stew.<br><br> Committee members, many of whom are in Sartoria this morning, had worked hard since then to coordinate a week&#x2019;s worth of wool promotions and photo ops all over England, designed to remind people that wool was warm, natural, comfortable, and sustainable. Field Day was their marquee event and, it must be said, the one that seemed most likely to have taken shape over a second pour of Laphroaig. (&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that? Sheep? On Savile Row? Smashing idea, old cod!&#x201d;)<br><br> Before dawn this morning, trailers arriving from Devon, in southwest England&#x2019;s moor country, had deposited sixty bathed and fluffed sheep in their temporary pasture. These weren&#x2019;t just any sheep: one group was the U.K.&#x2019;s last remaining flock of Bowmont sheep, developed by genetics researchers in Scotland in the 1980s by crossing Saxon Merinos with white Shetlands, with the object of producing a hardy, fine-�fibered animal; the other was Exmoor Horn, a stocky, ancient black-�nosed breed with elegant backswept horns and a long, dense white fleece. The farmers, too, had been groomed for the occasion. Two historic tailoring houses, Huntsman and Anderson &amp; Sheppard, had outfitted them&#x2014;�and their dogs&#x2014;�in bespoke attire using English wool woven on English looms.<br><br> &#x201c;This is proper cloth,&#x201d; a mill executive is saying to the audience in Sartoria. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the cloth that, before Gore-�Tex and Polarfleece, a gentleman would put on a tweed jacket with a stout pair of shoes and walk up Everest.&#x201d;<br><br> The line gets a laugh, but nostalgia mists across the room as if it had been sprayed from a fine-�nozzled hose.<br><br> I head outside to see the flocks and to get a feel for Savile Row, the quarter-�mile side street that is as meaningful to men who are reverent about handmade clothing as Cooperstown is to baseball fans and St. Andrews is to golfers. A dozen or so of the block&#x2019;s tailors are hosting open houses, and several have scheduled short presentations about some aspect of their business. This is, from what I have read, an extremely rare show of hospitality by a group that, for most of its history, has preferred to keep its activities behind drawn curtains and unmarked closed doors. Open-�to-�the-�street windows, in fact, were unheard of until 1969, when maverick designer Tommy Nutter set up shop with master cutter Edward Sexton at 35a Savile Row, with the partial backing of Peter Brown, the managing director of the Beatles&#x2019; Apple Corps, whose headquarters were across the street.<br><br> Nutter was the darling of mod London. Mick and Bianca Jagger, Twiggy, Elton John, and John Lennon (who, according to the author and historian James Sherwood, was known in the Nutter workrooms by the code name Susan) all sported his signature three-�piece suits, with their giant skate-�wing lapels, nipped-�in waists, and roomy trousers. Every Beatle except George Harrison wore his designs for the Abbey Road album cover. As if his designs alone weren&#x2019;t enough to shake up Savile Row&#x2019;s Old Guard, Nutter also dared to show off his wares in provocative window displays&#x2014;�one featured giant purple phallus-�shaped candles and another, taxidermied rats&#x2014;�created by a young Simon Doonan, who would go on to become the creative director of Barneys. Nutter not only allowed passers-�by to see into his mirrored-�wall showroom; he also had the audacity to encourage them to come in and browse.<br><br> Nutter died in 1992, of complications from AIDS, but if he had lived he probably would have loved the spectacle that is Savile Row today. There are banker types teetering between vexed and amused as they make their way through the crowd; tourists in jeans and windbreakers posing in front of the caution: sheep ahead sign; buttonhole makers and pressers, up from their basement workrooms, taking extended cigarette breaks; and film crews who can&#x2019;t seem to get enough of Harry Parker, the tweed-�clad, apple-�cheeked, staff-�wielding farmer who appears to be having the time of his life herding his Exmoor Horns from one end of the narrow corral to the other as the cameras roll. And at the top of the street, on a roped-�off square of sod, there are several people drinking champagne inside what is apparently an invitation-�only sheep trailer, painted a splendid Prussian blue.<br><br> Savile Row was developed in the 1730s, on what had been part of the third Earl of Burlington&#x2019;s estate, a large manicured spread on Piccadilly Street in London&#x2019;s then mostly rural West End. As Richard Walker explains in The Savile Row Story: An Illustrated History, Lord Burlington was a well-�traveled sophisticate and a talented amateur architect who poured an obsession with ancient Rome into the construction of Burlington House, his neo-�Palladian palace. Though he had wealth of his own and had married an heiress named Dorothy Savile, his extravagances left him strapped for cash. To raise money, he was forced to develop a chunk of his land. He laid out a handful of streets&#x2014;�Old Burlington, Cork, Clifford, Boyle, and, later, New Burlington and Savile (named for his wife in a bid, perhaps, for redemption after selling off her gardens). Lord Burlington oversaw the building of blocks of town houses, which were soon occupied by aristocrats, military men, and surgeons. Naturally, they needed proper attire, and before long tailors had opened workshops nearby to serve them.<br><br> The West End was booming at a time when ideas about how gentlemen should dress were going through a radical change. After the French Revolution, there was widespread rejection of anything that smacked of Louis XVI&#x2013;�style self-�indulgence and excess. There was also a surge in appreciation for the classic nude male body, as depicted in ancient Greek sculpture. Meanwhile, the English gentry were discovering the great outdoors, retreating on weekends to country homes, where they spent much of their time foxhunting and dale-�walking and pursuing other activities that required unfussy, comfortable attire. When some of these squires wore their country clothes into the city, they helped fuel a desire, even among urban sophisticates, for well-�cut apparel made from matte-�finish fabrics in subdued colors.<br><br> &#x201c;It happened quickly,&#x201d; Richard Walker wrote. &#x201c;One moment the average aristocrat was wrapped in velvet and lace and the next he was stepping out in rustic simplicity.&#x201d;<br><br> Without the distraction of sheen and sparkle, the focus became the figure of the man himself. Skilled tailors were much in demand. Using shaping techniques and strategically placed padding, they could give almost anyone&#x2014;�pigeon-�breasted or pot-�bellied&#x2014;�that coveted V-�shaped silhouette.<br><br> &#x201c;The perfect man, as conceived by English tailors, was part English country gentleman, part innocent natural Adam, and part naked Apollo,&#x201d; the art historian Anne Hollander wrote in Sex and Suits. &#x201c;Dressed form was now an abstraction of nude form, a new ideal naked man expressed not in bronze or marble but in natural wool, linen and leather.&#x201d;<br>Jim Fogel Book Composition jfogel@nmsgbooks.com 717-392-7438<br></p><h2>Snows of Yesteryear</h2><p>Recounts the author&#39;s aristocratic childhood in Romania in the days before World War II</p><p>Gregor von Rezzori (1914&#x2013;1998) was born in Czernowitz (now Chernovtsy, Ukraine), Bukovina, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

For the rest of the nation the day may have been Father's Day, but for Love every day on a golf course is father's day. <br> It was Davis Love, Jr., master professional and legendary teacher, who taught his son the game in all its beautiful complexity. As a child, Davis III was encouraged just to play, to enjoy the game as he grew and developed his athletic skills, to find the pleasure in the game that can lead to the desire for improvement. But when, early in his teens, Davis III declared himself ready to take golf seriously, to put in the time to learn and understand the physical and mental components of the game that turn a golfer into a champion, his father was delighted, determined, and ready. <br> With every shot he takes, Davis Love III provides a tribute to the strength and the value of his father's teachings. And in <i>Every Shot I Take,</i> he shares with us the lessons he learned about how to play golf with power, with skill, and with joy. Those lessons range widely, from the psychological ("Let your attitude determine your golf game; don't let your golf game determine your attitude") to the physical ("To hit the ball far, hit the ball straight; I try to hit the ball at 80 percent of my overall power, because at 80 percent I have a much better chance of hitting the ball with the center of the clubface") to the technical ("When you begin your downswing, and your left foot returns to the ground, put your cleats in the same holes they were in originally"). They include drills like the Hitchhike Drill, where you place your right hand behind your back and your left thumb on your right shoulder, then in a spinning motion move your thumb to your left shoulder -- that's the golf swing in miniature! There are the Ten Commandments of Putting, six steps to successful long bunker shots, and tips for playing in the wind and rain, on fast greens, or out of long rough. Yet all are ultimately about something more than golf. <br> Golf was, for Davis, Jr., a way of being a father, of teaching his sons how to learn, how to approach whatever they might choose to do with knowledge and with care, how to overcome obstacles through dedication and understanding. It was the vehicle through which he taught the most important lesson of all: "Follow your dream, and enjoy the trip." <br> Through this moving tribute to his father's love, Davis III passes along the benefits of those lessons in a gem of a book that will improve your golf game -- and enhance your life.</p><p>It's hard enough to carry the name of a famous father. Davis Love III took on even more pressure when he stepped into his famous father's spikes and went out, like his father before him, to earn his living on the Professional Golf Association tour. Fortunately for the son, the father was not only a fine player, he was also one of the country's most respected golf teachers, and he taught his son well. Love III's homage to Love Jr., who was killed in a plane crash, is a literal love-fest, a gracefully emotional hybrid of personal memoir and golfing wisdom. Like Harvey Penick's <i>Little Red Book,</i> the instructional portion of <i>Every Shot I Take,</i> collected from the father's compulsive note-takings, is filled with the kinds of nuggets--practical and inspirational--that golfers cling to when the sweet spot on their clubs begins to turn sour.Michael Bamberger, a writer and columnist for <i>GOLF Magazine, </i>spent twenty-two years as a writer at&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>&nbsp;after thirteen years as a newspaper reporter.

O'Keeffe, an artist of immense stature in twentieth-century art, is known primarily as a painter. However, her earliest mature works, which led to her first New York exhibitions and initial acclaim, were works on paper as well, and she resumed her intense commitment to drawing and watercolor in the 1960s and 1970s. The works on paper can be viewed in the larger context of O'Keeffe's career as an artist. They move from stylized, flat patterning of the early charcoals to the rhapsodic organic forms and fresh uses of color in the watercolors to the tighter, more focused compositions of the later pastels, charcoals, and pencil drawings. Finally, the works on paper of the 1960s and 1970s are characterized by an extreme simplification and almost decorative flatness.

You can see it in people's eyes and hear it in their voices. It's a feeling that seems to be ever-present, despite our best efforts to overcome it.</p> <p>Living in Washington, D.C., during the Bush and Clinton administrations, I became acutely aware of the daily stress people encountered. The pulse of the nation was a constant flutter of activity, fueled by egos and paced by capitalism�thinly disguised as democracy. I was quick to learn how popular hell had become in the nation's capital: lawyers from hell, security clearance from hell and politics from hell. And that's not counting traffic, parking and violence�all from hell as well. One auspicious night, I took a cab home from National Airport during an ice storm, only to hear the driver remark about the "weather from hell." It was all I could do not to think that the underworld had finally frozen over.</p> <p>These truly are stressful times. The pace of life is fast, furious and becoming more so. A quick glance through the newspaper headlines, or a few minutes of television news, is enough to confirm that humans around the world are approaching a boiling point. The causes are many and varied: workplace intensity, government gridlock, AIDS, gang violence, downsizing, deforestation, ozone depletion, drug addictions, international terrorism, animal extinction and natural disasters. All of these problems put our planet and its people under immense stress.</p> <p>While the nation's capital seems to epitomize the frenzy of human emotions, stressful vibrations echo across the country�and beyond. This fact has not gone unnoticed by the World Health Organization (WHO). From various surveys and studies conducted in virtually every country, WHO now cites stress as a global epidemic. The mounting tension and strife only confirm what we already know at a deeper level: Stress has become a prominent and permanent part of the human landscape. It may be hard to remember, but it wasn't always like this.</p> <p>Before the 1960s, the topic of stress did not make headlines, nor was it a household word. However, the rapid rate of change, coupled with the increase of technology, has infiltrated all aspects of our lifestyles. Running right alongside it are the signs and symptoms of human stress. In essence, people are trying to keep pace with a hyper-productive society.</p> <p>Sunday, once esteemed as a day of rest to honor the godliness of creation, is now merely a day to get caught up with shopping, errands and work before the deluge starts all over again on Monday.</p> <p>Technology once held the promise to make our lives simpler and more efficient, and to provide additional leisure time. Yet research studies show that instead of more leisure time, we have less. Although gadgets like beepers, laptop computers, pagers, cellular phones, microwave ovens, fax machines, e-mail and voice mail appear to make us organized and efficient, we have in truth become slaves to these technologies.</p> <p>In his book <i>Modern Man in Search of a Soul</i>, noted psychologist Carl Jung warned that advances in technology, accompanied with increased materialism, would lead to a greater split of the conscious and unconscious mind�in other words, the ego and the soul.(1)</p> <p>This prophecy, made in 1933, has come to pass as we near the end of the twentieth century. The pace of life today has made us more distant from not only the elements of nature, but our divine essence as well. It is no coincidence that as technology (and the cultural values associated with it) advances to dizzying heights, we find ourselves in a period of spiritual dormancy.</p> <p>I believe there is an inherent relationship between stress and human spirituality. What seemed obvious to me at the intuitive level was often dismissed in graduate school seminars�until I taught an undergraduate course in stress management. Then the pieces began to fit into a larger picture.</p> <p>Upon assuming the role of teacher, I became aware of a number of interesting questions. The students were not so much interested in the relaxation techniques being taught as they were concerned about the issues of relationships, values and the purpose of life. On one hand I was surprised that none of these issues was found in any stress textbook; on the other hand these issues are so obvious, I wondered why they were not included. It became clear that these students were addressing matters of the heart and issues of the soul.</p> <p>Detaching from my own problems and concerns, I could clearly see that stress and spirituality were not opposite ends of a continuum, but partners in the dance of life. I was delighted; one doesn't learn this in academia, especially not in graduate school. In fact, I think it's fair to say that in the mid-1980s, one didn't mention the word spirituality in the same breath as science. There was an unspoken assumption that they were mutually exclusive.</p> <p>What I pieced together then, and what is coming to be better understood now, is that the spiritual dimension is not only present in the human equation; it is an integral, if not essential, part of it. In order to really understand the human journey, we must acknowledge and nurture these matters of the soul on a daily basis.</p> <p>Thus began my exploration into the dynamics of mind-body-spirit integration, human consciousness and a synthesis of reflections on stress and human spirituality. This has been the focus of my own journey, both professionally and personally; I know I am not alone in this quest.</p><br> <b>Stress with a Human Face</b><br><br> <p>When we hear on the news about a crisis in a distant city or remote corner of the world, we can easily detach ourselves from it. But when stress and tension are in our own environment�at home and/or work�it is impossible to ignore it. It is becoming increasingly difficult to cope with these overwhelming issues.</p> <p>The expression "stress with a human face" reflects a sense of compassion in a tense situation. Taken literally, it means a troubled mind. Our faces clearly reflect the intensity and volume of stress in our lives. Look at photos of Jimmy Carter before and after he became president of the United States. It looks as if Carter aged 20 years during one four-year term. While the job as chief executive is extremely stressful, anybody can experience the same effects of stress�even without being president.</p> <p>About two weeks after Nancy Kerrigan fell prey to the emotional insecurities of Tonya Harding, I appeared on Fox Morning News to talk about competitive anxiety. Prior to that incident, I was on the faculty of the American University in the department of health and fitness, teaching a popular course in stress management. I also counseled several nationally known athletes, actors and corporate executives in stress management therapy. This particular interview was scheduled to be five minutes in length. The focus was Kerrigan-Harding, competitive anxiety and Olympic pressure on athletes.</p> <p>Toward the end of this segment, however, the questions from the news anchor became more general in nature. With 20 seconds remaining, she asked, "How does anyone deal with stress?"</p> <p>Watching the seconds rapidly tick away, I realized I could not do justice to this question in the remaining few moments. With a smile I said, "I can't answer that in a sound byte."</p> <p>She gave me a nasty look, thanked me and moved on to the news.</p> <p>As I left, I wondered if I could have given a better answer, since that question is posed to me fairly often. These days I can distill the message of managing stress into one word: BALANCE.</p> <p>Balance is the ability to achieve a sense of symmetry in our lives. This is not an innate talent but a learned skill; one that must be practiced regularly and mindful of our spiritual essence. In other words, there are no quick fixes to stress. We must look deep into the soul to answer these concerns. This can be a long, arduous process with no speedy solutions. Unfortunately, people are looking for quick answers to monumental problems.</p> <p>Some of my best teachers in college were my students. One day while discussing the concept of balance in my stress management class, one student raised his hand and shared an ancient proverb from his t'ai chi course. He explained that balance is a fundamental skill in t'ai chi, as well as a principle of the Taoist philosophy.</p> <p>The saying is: "Stand like mountain, move like water." Now <i>that's</i> a sound byte.</p> <p>The message is colorful, poetic, profound�yet so simple. The vision of mountains and water is one I find very soothing, but the significance of the message is even more so. The union of opposites as a means to achieve wholeness is common in the Taoist tradition. To stand like a mountain suggests a sense of stability, resistant to the winds of change. To move like water implies the ability to go with the flow, rather than trying to change things we have no control over. To move like water is to persevere, yield where necessary to gain strength, and move on once again. What this ageless wisdom advises is to have strength and security in your own being, like a mountain, yet at the same time hold the fluidity of moving water. Here was an ancient metaphor giving life to the concept of balance. I took an immediate liking to it.</p> <p>The concept of balance can be found in virtually every culture since the dawn of humanity. Americans may be familiar with the aspect of balance in life through the biblical passage in Ecclesiastes (3:2-9), also made popular in a 1960s hit song, <i>Turn, Turn, Turn</i>, first by Pete Seeger, then again by the rock group The Byrds. Benjamin Hoff's popular book, <i>The Tao of Pooh</i>, also serves as a gentle reminder that the essence of Taoism is really a universal concept. The Native Americans have a similar phrase, "walking in balance," which they use to describe this philosophy of a peaceful coexistence and harmony with all aspects of life.</p> <p>To walk in balance requires steadiness. The concept of balance is universal in appeal and ageless in wisdom. It is this wisdom that helps us address the matters of the soul when we meet resistance brought on by the winds of change.</p><br> <b>Walking in Balance</b><br><br> <p>No doubt the image of balance is familiar to everyone. We learn about it early in life when we stand upright and attempt to take our first steps. From riding a bike to pulling out our checkbooks, the importance of balance cannot be understated. Indeed, it is a component of every aspect of our lives. Perhaps nowhere is the aspect of balance so evident than in the examples of nature (e.g., the seasons and oceanic tides), where stability serves as the proverbial correction factor in maintaining earthly dynamics. We, too, are a part of nature, even though the walls of a home or office can seem like an impassable barrier that denies access to the great outdoors. As one close friend told me, the closest he gets to nature is the Discovery Channel.</p> <p>There are those who would strongly argue that the unparalleled stress we are facing today is a result of our separation from nature. Whether you agree with this premise or not, you can appreciate the connection made between stress and imbalance, for it seems obvious that when we are overwhelmed with responsibilities, challenged beyond our means or at the end of our wits, we feel imbalanced. We are first figuratively, and then perhaps quite literally, knocked off our feet.</p> <p>Stress is the epitome of imbalance. Flat tires, delayed flights, bounced checks, phone tag, long checkout lines, flippant adolescents, cancerous tumors and backed-up traffic can all disturb our psychic equilibrium.</p> <p>Episodes of stress tend to hit above our center of gravity (at the point of ego) and metaphorically speaking, knock us off our feet. This metaphor becomes reality when stressors manifest as headaches, backaches or other maladies that can literally lay us flat on our back. Perhaps in terms of effective stress management, the concept of balance is best summed up in the words of Reinhold Neibuhr, now entitled "The Serenity Prayer," and used by every self-help group grounded in the tradition of Alcoholics Anonymous: "God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference." </p> <p>In other words, stand like mountain, move like water!</p> <p>To fully understand the dynamics of stress and how it can knock us off balance, it is best to reacquaint ourselves with the basics, starting with some definitions and progressing to the profound relationship between stress and disease. As you will see, every aspect of stress is undeniably intertwined with the essence of human spirituality.</p><br> <b>Definitions of Stress</b><br><br> <p>Perhaps the word stress needs no explanation. At some instinctual level we all know what it means. Feelings of being overwhelmed, impatience, panic, anger, frustration, helplessness, anxiety, as well as boredom�all are aspects of stress. Just the same, if you were to ask the first 10 people you meet on the street what their definition of stress is, most likely you would hear 10 completely different answers. Academicians are no closer to an agreed-upon definition either.</p> <p>My definition of stress has changed and evolved over the past 15 years. I was first taught that stress was wear and tear on the body, much like repeated driving can produce wear on a car transmission. (2) To a large extent this is true. However, from a scientific point of view�grounded in Western thought in which the body is compared to a machine�this definition is incomplete. We are not machines!</p> <p>Stress is often defined as the inability to cope with demands placed on a person. (3) One only need think of a frazzled mother attempting to care for newborn twins, or an office manager seated behind a mound of invoices with a phone at each ear, to understand this meaning. I have also heard stress described as "any change we encounter in our lives," and although this notion has merit, this vague definition lacks soul.</p> <p>What experts do agree on is that stress is a perception�real or imagined�that is interpreted as a threat. If the threat is not resolved, then the effects will produce wear and tear on the body�either in a specific organ or body region. What begins in the mind as a perception often ends up as a symptom of disease or illness if left unresolved. In the worst-case scenario, the body becomes the battlefield for the war games of the mind.</p> <p>In the past decade a new definition has emerged from the fields of transpersonal and humanistic psychology that springs from a spiritual place. From this perspective, stress is seen as a feeling of separateness from God, a feeling of being disconnected from our divine source. This perception is really an illusion, for we are never really detached from God.</p> <p>Perhaps poet Maya Angelou said it best when she wrote,</p> <blockquote><i>I believe that Spirit is one and everywhere present. That it never leaves me. That in my ignorance I may withdraw from it, but I can realize its presence the instant I return to my senses. (4)</i></blockquote><br> <p>To say that stress is a disconnection from God holds much merit in a world where people yearn to reconnect to the divine source. While this feeling of separateness may be incorrect, the emotions generated from it are very real. Furthermore, as stress-based perceptions increase, we frequently become victims of our own attitudes and beliefs.

The members of the Circle responded to modern art by created a unique aesthetic based on contemporary surrealism and abstraction, and they did so drawing from their own fertile imaginations.<br><br>In his essay on the Circle, Scott Grant Barker relates the personal and captivating history of these eleven young artists fro whom the standards of the day were no longer acceptable. Jane Myers writes to the aesthetic evolution of their work, including their artistic techniques and influences. The catalogue also includes succinct biographies, accompanied by photographs, of each fop the artists.<br><br>Among the legends and legendary figures in Forth Worth&#x2019;s past &#x2013; and there are many &#x2013; the artists of the Fort Worth Circle occupy a special place as pioneers of modern art in a city that is today one of the preeminent art meccas in the United States.

It is evident that the general idea of the book is based upon Jacob&#39;s last words to his sons as recorded in Gen. xlix. 1-27. Just as Jacob portrays the character of his sons and declares to them what shall befall them, so in our book each of the patriarchs is represented as describing, in some sense, his own character and as foretelling what shall come to pass among his posterity in the last times. From this latter point of view the book partakes of the character of a prophetic-apocalyptic work. In six of the testaments, those of Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Dan, Naphthali and Joseph, there is a certain correspondence between our book and Gen. xlix. regarding the characters of the patriarchs; as for the remaining six patriarchs no such correspondence exists.</p><p></p><h2>Carving the Nativity with Helen Gibson</h2><p>In this wonderful new book an old tradition is shared with today&#39;s carvers. Helen Gibson, a new author at Schiffer Publishing, teaches woodcarving at the John C. Campbell Folk School in North Carolina. The patterns for the creche she carves have been part of the tradition of the school for so long that no one is quite sure of their origins. Carving them is a community effort, with different carvers having different specialties. Helen takes the reader step-by-step through the delicate carving process of one of the figures, with clear color photography illustrating each technique. Patterns and complete views for the Mary, Joseph, three Wisemen, three Shepherds, and the baby in the manager are included. Helen started carving when she was in about the fifth grade.

A child&#x2019;s ability to listen well affects every aspect of his or her life. But for some 1.5 million children in the United States who have normal hearing and intelligence, communication and language are blocked. Words are jumbled and distorted. These children have a hard time following directions and become frustrated in trying to make themselves understood, which often leads to unruly behavior, poor school performance, social isolation, and low self-esteem.<br><br>Auditory Processing Disorder (APD) affects the brain&#x2019;s ability to accurately process the sounds of speech, which in turn impedes the ability to communicate. Experts are just beginning to unlock the mystery of this confounding condition. As a result, APD is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. But hope is here. Now veteran speech-language pathologist Lois Kam Heymann offers the first practical guide to help parents dramatically improve the listening and language skills of their children, whether they have a diagnosed auditory processing disorder, slow language development&#x2014;or simply need practice listening. Inside this reassuring, action-oriented book you&#x2019;ll find<br>&nbsp;<br>� easy-to-identify milestones to help parents pinpoint challenges that may arise during each stage of their child&#x2019;s development from birth to age eight<br>� the tools and checklists needed to assist parents in recognizing APD early<br>� tips to distinguish APD from other listening/learning disorders, including ADD, ADHD, LPD, and PDD<br>� methods to encourage a child&#x2019;s natural listening abilities through books, stories, nursery rhymes, songs, lullabies, toys, and games <br>� home techniques to hone a child&#x2019;s auditory processing&#x2014;whether he or she has severe APD limitations or just needs to build listening &#x201c;muscles&#x201d;<br>� specific suggestions on how to improve a child&#x2019;s listening skills outside the home&#x2014;at school, during after-school activities, even when at a restaurant<br>� an analysis of traditional classroom settings and effective ways parents can advocate for better sound quality<br>� guidelines for finding the right professionals to work with your child<br>&nbsp;<br>With hands-on ways for improving a child&#x2019;s ability to listen to instructions, process information, and follow directions, parents can turn simple activities into powerful listening lessons in only minutes a day. The bottom line: Learning how to listen in our noisy, complicated world is the key to a happy and engaged child.</p><p>Lois Kam Heymann, MA, CCC-SLP, is a recognized leader in the treatment of children with listening, learning, and auditory challenges.

Why didn&#x2019;t Billy Ray look at her, even when Margaret took him in her arms and murmured his name? Margaret had a powerful sense that the sounds her little boy made, so different in pitch and tone from her first child&#x2019;s coos and giggles were just, well, wrong. And Margaret rarely had any sense that her son was making his baby sounds in response to the things his mom said or did.<br><br>Her doctor assured her there was nothing to worry about. &#x201c;Boys start to talk later than girls,&#x201d; he explained. &#x201c;Besides, Billy Ray is the second child in the family. His need to communicate with you is not as great.&#x201d; Well, he&#x2019;s the doctor, Margaret thought. Yet in her heart, she just couldn&#x2019;t accept these reasonable-sounding explanations. Margaret felt deep down that Billy Ray should be responding more to her and her husband&#x2019;s voices and the sounds and noises in their home. Based on her experience with her first child, she sensed that the pre-speech vocalizations Billy Ray made should be different from what they were. Reaching for a box of rice one afternoon at home, Margaret impulsively rattled it behind Billy Ray&#x2019;s head. When he again failed to react, Margaret knew what she had to do. The following day, she had Billy Ray&#x2019;s hearing checked, fully expecting that her child had a hearing impairment.<br><br>The results came back normal.<br><br>Undeterred, Margaret arranged for consultations with two separate pediatric neurologists. After a battery of tests and examinations with Billy Ray and a lengthy interview with Margaret, both doctors concluded that Billy Ray had pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Margaret had never heard of PDD, a condition involving developmental delays of socialization and communication skills. She tried to be as upbeat as possible as each neurologist explained what PDD was and described a therapeutic preschool and the necessary therapy that would accommodate Billy Ray&#x2019;s special needs. Margaret was grateful for the diagnosis&#x2014;having one gave her something new to focus her efforts on&#x2014;but worried that the doctors were sentencing her beautiful little boy to a life of isolation. Nevertheless, Margaret did the research, fought with her insurance company, and adjusted her family&#x2019;s budget so that Billy Ray could attend the school and receive the therapy that both doctors recommended.<br><br>But by age two Billy Ray was still uncommunicative. Worse, as he grew from infant to toddler, Billy Ray&#x2019;s inability to listen began to be an educational and social ball and chain for him. Frustrated by an invisible wall that complicated and confused nearly everything he was asked to do, Billy Ray cried and acted out a lot. Unable to state his own needs or understand what other boys and girls asked for, he pushed and grabbed for toys, upsetting his peers and testing his teachers&#x2019; patience. As his mother looked on helplessly, Billy Ray increasingly retreated into a world of his own. Instead of each new day offering a chance to grow, develop, and interact more meaningfully and happily with the world around him, Margaret, Billy Ray, and their family faced a daily struggle simply to cope.<br><br>Margaret could see how much it hurt and confused Billy Ray when he misunderstood and was in turn misunderstood, but she was at a loss as to how best to help her son. It felt as if Billy Ray was on the other side of a door, knocking for her to unlock it, and Margaret simply didn&#x2019;t have the key. Increasingly Margaret worried that if she couldn&#x2019;t find a way to open the door and lead Billy Ray out into the full, rich world of experience, her little boy would never be able to play and connect with his sister, make friends in school, fall in love, go to college, or live on his own. Margaret redoubled the hunt for the key. There must be something she&#x2019;d missed, someone she hadn&#x2019;t consulted. She made calls, quizzed other parents, scanned parenting websites and chat boards, and read and reread everything she could find about Billy Ray&#x2019;s diagnosed disorder, PDD.<br><br>Along the way she happened upon a website that described yet another three-letter syndrome. When she read the symptoms of APD or auditory processing disorder, she could scarcely believe it. Here was the exact list of what Billy Ray was going through. Children with APD:<br><br>�Have trouble listening and hearing, especially in noisy environments<br>�Struggle to distinguish between similar-sounding words and sounds<br>�Don&#x2019;t follow directions well<br>�Frequently ask for clarification and to have words repeated<br>�Do poorly in reading and reading comprehension, spelling, and other classes where verbal directions are key<br>�Fare better in independent activities and classes where listening isn&#x2019;t a central requirement<br>One other item made her sit bolt upright:<br>�Are often misdiagnosed with other disorders such as ADD (attention deficit disorder), ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and pervasive developmental delay (PDD)<br><br>Intrigued&#x2014;and hopeful that perhaps there would be more that she could do for Billy Ray if this was his true problem&#x2014;Margaret started to look further and asked more questions of the growing list of specialists she&#x2019;d already consulted. She felt she was on the path to discovering how to unlock the proverbial door for her son.<br><br>Margaret is certainly not alone in her search to help unlock the door to healthy development for her son. If you&#x2019;re reading this book, you likely suspect that your own child has one of these three-letter syndromes, or you already have a suggested diagnosis in hand and are trying to digest as much information as possible going forward.<br><br>Generally speaking, auditory processing disorder is a term for a group of conditions in which the parts of a child&#x2019;s brain tasked with turning sound into language and hearing into listening don&#x2019;t do their jobs right. How this issue develops and at what age it most often does so is little understood&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll discuss this more below&#x2014;but it is estimated that between 1.5 million and 2.5 million children a year are diagnosed with this disorder. Because auditory pathways leading from the ear into the brain and the auditory processing centers within the brain itself are continuously developing throughout infancy and early childhood, it&#x2019;s not possible to screen for and definitively establish the presence of an APD in a child until she or he is six or seven years old. A specific diagnosis detailing the magnitude of the APD as well as any related or concurrent problems such as ADD or ADHD and the right course of therapy and treatment cannot in turn be made until the child is seven or eight. But there are clearly many, many more younger children dealing with these listening difficulties. We think some children are even born with this issue. Unfortunately, because the development of auditory processing skills is linked with a growing child&#x2019;s use of language and increasingly complex communications and social interactions and cannot be accurately measured until those skills develop, parents have to go without formal diagnosis and intervention for too long. The ideas in this book will help you understand what&#x2019;s at stake in your child&#x2019;s listening development and in turn help your child from the moment you begin to suspect that there may be a problem. You don&#x2019;t need to wait for a formal diagnosis to begin to help.<br><br><i>THE ABCS OF APD<br></i><br><br>In broad strokes, it&#x2019;s easiest to understand hearing&#x2014;the process of experiencing sound&#x2014;as a two-stage phenomenon. First, sound vibrations are collected by the outer ear, funneled to the inner ear, where they become physical vibrations, and then sent on to the cochlea, where they are transformed into electrical impulses. Then these impulses travel along the eighth cranial nerve into the brain.<br><br>As the electrical impulses enter and go deeper into the brain, they pass through a series of relay stations in which the auditory information they carry is analyzed for timing (duration), intensity (volume), and frequency (pitch). The sound signals from each ear also get switched over like railcars changing tracks and are rerouted to the opposite side of the brain. Sound received in the right ear is sent to the left auditory cortex, while sound from the left ear goes to the right auditory cortex. The auditory cortex is a specialized area within the cerebral cortex that organizes, analyzes, and transforms sound information into the sensations and reactions that we recognize as language and speech. For most people the left cortex does the lion&#x2019;s share of the work.<br><br>Once inside these brain centers, sound impulses are put through a highly sophisticated and detailed battery of analyses and examinations contoured by memory, instinct, thought, and various voluntary and involuntary reactions into the sensation we experience as hearing. It&#x2019;s a complex process&#x2014;one that simultaneously incorporates multiple locations of brain geography, a system of feedback to the cochlea to help narrow the focus of hearing, and a myriad of other analyses, impulses, gateways, functions, and processes. All this happens in a fraction of a second.<br><br>Most people recognize that birth defects, infections, blockages, eardrum punctures, tinnitus from loud noises, and various other things can adversely affect the middle and inner ear, important parts of the hearing equation. But a lot can also go wrong during a sound&#x2019;s journey along the eighth cranial nerve through the relay stations and inside the auditory cortex. APD is a condition that affects that interior trip to the auditory cortex and the processing stage that transforms hearing into listening within the cortex itself.<br><br><i>THE DEVELOPMENTAL LADDER</i><br><br>Since we don&#x2019;t yet know what causes APD and can&#x2019;t predict at what age it may develop, it&#x2019;s important to understand the typical developmental milestones common to most young children. These developmental milestones are a loose guide. They can help you to zero in on your child&#x2019;s listening development. If your child&#x2019;s listening and speaking skills don&#x2019;t come anywhere near the trajectory I describe, APD may be the problem. Keep in mind that the ideas, observations, and indications that follow are not one-size-fits-all. A child&#x2019;s journey to developmental maturity is a ladder of many rungs. Your son or daughter can pause on one rung longer than another child the same age, skip one, or even go back a few and still be well within the range of &#x201c;normal.&#x201d; Always keep in mind that variation and individual timing is the natural order of things when it comes to growing children.<br><br><i>Birth to Three Months</i><br><br>�Newborns listen to sounds that are close to them.<br>�Unexpected or loud sounds may startle them or make them cry.<br>�New and interesting sounds may calm them or cause them to stop movement and &#x201c;listen&#x201d; or attend. Recognizing attention in a newborn can be tricky at first. Sometimes it&#x2019;s visible only in an interruption of sucking on a pacifier or a bottle.<br>�The baby begins to localize and turn in the direction of a sound source.<br>�A familiar voice gets greeted with a familiar expression, sound, or gesture.<br>�The baby responds to soft, comforting tones.<br><br>In the first ninety days of life, a newborn infant is fully occupied by the basic needs for comfort, food, rest, hygiene, and love. During these first beautiful months your baby spends most of his or her day sleeping and being kept clean, fed, and adored. At the same time that your baby begins to develop a sense of touch she also begins to respond to the trust and warmth she soaks up from the people who care for her. By the third month your baby begins to grasp and hold things such as rattles and stuffed animals, and fully expects that her comfort and contact needs will be met.<br>Initially your baby communicates by crying. You and the other adults around her begin to read her signals and recognize that the specific cry for being hungry is different from the cry for being wet. Soon she will start making other sounds and playing with her growing ability to vocalize; she will repeat sounds that get your attention and approval.<br><br><i>Three to Six Months</i><br><br>�Sounds begin to have meaning.<br>�A child begins to respond to &#x201c;no.&#x201d;<br>�The baby recognizes changes in a voice&#x2019;s loudness and pitch.<br>�He or she starts to associate word meaning with sound.<br>�The baby listens to his or her own voice.<br>�Rhythm and music draw their own reaction.<br>�The baby shows an interest in toys that pair sound with movement, such as rattles, musical mobiles, or anything else designed to make noise when it moves or is moved.<br>�The baby demonstrates increased attention to more varied environmental sounds, such as a vacuum cleaner, a fan, or a door slamming in another room.<br><br>At the ninety-day mark, your baby is now ready to play. She is awake for longer periods of time, is more physically active and clearly enjoys interacting with you. She can now grasp objects and bring them to her mouth for more sensory exploration. If your play involves language, your baby is ready to experience that, too. At this age a child can create vowel-like (&#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;e,&#x201d; &#x201c;o&#x201d;) and consonant-like (&#x201c;p,&#x201d; &#x201c;b,&#x201d; &#x201c;m&#x201d;) sounds.<br><br><i>Six to Twelve Months<br></i><br>�The child begins to listen and pay attention when spoken to.<br>�He or she responds to his or her name by turning.<br>�He or she is able to focus on listening for longer periods of time.<br>�The baby begins to like and play games that pair voice with movements.<br>�Familiar words (names of daily used objects and frequently seen people) are recognized in familiar contexts.<br>�The baby responds to familiar requests, such as waving bye-bye or being asked to give something to the parent.<br>�The child recognizes sounds paired with objects, such as an animal sound with the appropriate animal.<br><br>Your baby is awake even more and therefore more available to play. At six to twelve months a baby loves to look at books and pictures with you and is becoming much more physically active. She&#x2019;s developing a longer attention span, sitting by herself, crawling, pulling herself up to standing, and possibly even taking her first steps. She shows off her developing fine motor skills while playing with blocks and stacking rings. As the twelve-month mark approaches, she clearly understands more about the world around her.<br><br><i>One to Two Years</i><br><br>�The child begins to show specific comprehension of words.<br>�He or she can point out and identify pictures and objects by their names.<br>�He or she can also point to simple body parts on themselves and others.<br>�The child will now imitate words he or she hears.<br>�The child can follow one-step commands or questions such as &#x201c;Throw the ball&#x201d; or &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the kitty?&#x201d;<br>�He or she likes listening to simple stories.<br>�The child loves to listen to songs and rhymes and can incorporate body and hand movements to go with some of them.<br><br>During this time your baby&#x2019;s speech makes a big leap forward. Over the course of year one to two, most children go from babbling to creating nonsense words to learning and using real words and finally to using real words in two-word combinations. Increasingly your child enjoys playing with things that represent actual objects, such as using a block as a truck. She also explores her environment, learning how to walk and even how to climb stairs and using fine motor skills to manipulate simple one-piece puzzles.</p><h2>Nobody&#39;s Child Anymore: Grieving, Caring and Comforting When Parents Die</h2><p>As longevity expands so too does the reality that increasing numbers of people become Nobody&#39;s Child Anymore. Unlike most books on grieving the loss of a parent, Barbara Bartocci takes a comprehensive approach from caring for a dying parent through finding new meaning beyond grief. Barbara Bartocci, who has lost both of her parents, speaks from experience and offers poignant vignettes approaching hard questions with compassion and a wealth of practical wisdom. Nobody&#39;s Child Anymore is an immensely helpful and comforting resource for anyone caring for a dying parent, mourning the loss, caring for the remaining parent and seeking new meaning beyond grief. Introduction When our parents die and we are adults, we&#39;re expected to say, This is an appropriate death. My father . . . my mother . . . lived a full life. It is their time. I&#39;m okay with that. But we are not okay with it. Losing a parent--at any age--is a profound loss. It is such a primal connection, that of parent and child. No matter what your age, no matter what the circumstances of your rearing, no matter how loving or how lethal your relationship, it&#39;s impossible to completely ignore the people who gave you life. You can divorce a spouse but not your parents. There is that ultimate tie--the genetic inheritance that somehow entwines us no matter how hard we may try to disconnect. As society ages, and more people experience this inevitable passage, people are beginning to realize that it?s not an easy loss just because your parents are in their 60s, 70s, 80s, or even 90s. I was surprised at the depth of my pain when my parents died. And since there isn&#39;t yet a lot of cultural support when adults lose their parents, I had to feel my way, as if walking through an unfamiliar forest. I have written this book as a gentle guide through the forest of feelings you may be encountering. It is not a practical manual--turn to other sources for help in planning a funeral or settling an estate. Rather, I share my own experience and the thoughts and experiences of others as a source to ease your soul-pain. The four parts of this book parallel the four-fold experience of loss through which we pass. It begins when we are called upon to care for one of our parents and we come to the difficult realization that Mom or Dad is dying. Then, after the loss, we struggle with the pain of our grief and perhaps some unresolved issues in our relationship with our parents. At the same time, we are often called upon to offer comfort and support to our surviving parent. We may then lose a second parent and experience the special pain of becoming an adult &#34;orphan.&#34; Grieving is a process that has its own time. But eventually, we come to some resolution of our pain and we complete our grief. I have learned that there is a special light that may come in the wake of our parents&#39; leaving. I discovered, as you will, too, that in a deeper sense, our parents don&#39;t leave us. They become part of us.

One of the names in the notebook happens to be the Duke of Windsor. In 1992, a diver in the Caribbean finds the wreck of the vessel, and word gets back to the British authorities that the notebook is still onboard. Irish terrorist Sean Dillon is recruited to retrieve the item, but he's not the only one interested: a notorious drug dealer with Parliamentary connections is also in on the hunt.

And how far can Ruth trust herself?<br> <i>The Night Guest</i>, Fiona McFarlane's hypnotic first novel, is no simple tale of a crime committed and a mystery solved. This is a tale that soars above its own suspense to tell us, with exceptional grace and beauty, about ageing, love, trust, dependence, and fear; about processes of colonization; and about things (and people) in places they shouldn't be. Here is a new writer who comes to us fully formed, working wonders with language, renewing our faith in the power of fiction to describe the mysterious workings of our minds. </p><p>A <i>Kirkus Reviews </i>Best Fiction Book of 2013</p></p><p><strong>The Big Fall Books Preview 2013 (also an Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2013)</strong>: At age 75, Ruth is a widower, who lives alone in a remote beach home in Australia until one day a mysterious caretaker named Frida shows up to help around the house. But can Frida be trusted? Ruth's mind isn't what it once was, but she suspects her new friend isn't all that she seems. <i>The Night Guest</i> is an impressive debut--a tender novel about old age and a psychological meditation on isolation--that moves with the curious pace of a mystery. Fiona McFarlane is a new voice that reads as if she has the experience of a familiar voice, like she's been with us all along. <i>--Kevin Nguyen</i><b>Fiona McFarlane</b> was born in Sydney, Australia.

Back matter includes some tips for the leader.</p><p>Why do so many of us think of Christianity as a lifestyle to which we conform, rather than a God with whom we commune? Jesus gave His disciples the audacious promise that it was to their advantage that He go back to heaven because the Holy Spirit could then come to live inside of them. How many of us consider our connection to the Holy Spirit so strong and so real that we would call his presence in us better than Jesus beside us?</p><p>Throughout his Christian life, J.D. Greear felt disconnected to God and unsure about how to interact with Him. Although he had learned a lot of truths <i>about</i> God, these truths didn't seem to bring him any closer <i>to</i> Him. He tried to have such a relationship, but all of God&#x2019;s work seemed stockpiled in the past: He created the world, died on a cross, and left a Bible. God seemed like a busy teacher who had given an assignment and then stepped out of the room, leaving students to get the work done on their own.</p><p>But Greear discovered it doesn&#x2019;t have to be like that.

Today, we know this is not generally true. Modern criticism has joined with pre-Romantic criticism to expose common-sense as appropriate (because simple-minded), inadequate to comprehend and interpret verbal structures which are frequently 'non-[common]sensical,' anti-commonsensical, or even nonsensical.</p> <p>The difference between readers today and their earlier counterparts is that we have lost the full vocabulary of criticism and the consciousness of the literary and rhetorical devices with which texts are created. Yet these devices are still available to us, still practised even if unwittingly and on an impoverished scale.</p> <p>"Gradus," originally published in French in 1984, was designed to make good that loss, to reanimate those skills. Comprising some 4000 terms, defined and illustrated, it calls upon the resources of linguistics, poetics, semiotics, socio-criticism, rhetoric, pragmatics, combining them in ways which enable readers quickly to comprehend the codes and conventions which together make up 'literarity.' Skilfully translated into English, and adapted for an English-language audience with illustrations taken from an astonishing range of contemporary texts, literary and popular, drawn from literature, radio, television, and the theatre, "Gradus" will be a constant source of information and delight.</p></p><p><b>Albert W.

She then discusses the churches founded in the wake of early contacts with Europe, from the late fifteenth century on, and the unbroken Christian witness of Coptic Egypt and of Ethiopia. Isichei also examines the different types of Christianity in modern Africa and shows how social factors have influenced its development and expression.<br>With the explosive growth of Christianity now taking place in Africa - 393 million adherents projected by the year 2000 - and the increasingly recognized significance of African Christianity, this much-needed book fills the void in scholarly works on the continent's Christian past, also foreshadowing Christian Africa's influential future.</p><p>Elizabeth Isichei is professor of religious studies at Otago University, Dunedin, New Zealand.The word <i>encyclopedic</i> seems somehow inadequate for a book whose subject spans 2,000 years on a continent as large and diverse as Africa, a continent where--by some estimates--Christianity is expanding at a rate roughly double that at which it is declining in the Western world. But it is probably the best word available to convey the scope and style of Isichei's book, which is informative and readable and will surely become an important reference for historians and others interested in Africa, in Christianity, or in both. But as important as what it contains is what it does. Much of Christianity's history in Africa and elsewhere is inscribed in the tragic consequences of its confusion and entanglement with European culture and colonialism. By chronicling diverse African struggles to disentangle and encounter it anew, and by teasing out a thread of descent that predates colonialism, Isichei lays a foundation for a more conscious and critical encounter with Christianity's enculturation outside Africa as well as in. That is a welcome contribution to the understanding of Africa and Christianity, a corrective to a history of interpretation that has too often confused them with their "inventions" by the West. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>The Christmas Portrait</h2><p>When a young patient grieving the death of her sister recognizes the man in a portrait hanging in her office, Dr. Kate Harding, an art therapist, is startled but not entirely surprised.

Simon is not only American and gay but also a vampire whose sun sensitivity and blood sucking urges are controlled by medication. (Garlic, though, can be deadly.) Thrilled to be living in England, he is eager to make the village of Snupperton Mumsley his home, where he plans to write more of his well-known historical works and lucrative pot-boilers. Seeking to become part of the community, Simon joins the fundraising committee of St. Ethelwold's, the local church. At the first meeting an argument erupts between Lady Prunella Blitherington, matriarch of the village's first family, and Abigail Winterton, the town busybody and postmistress, about the choice of the play to be presented as the fundraiser. When Abigail, disliked by almost everyone, is found murdered the next day, Simon determines to find her killer and in so doing discovers all the sordid secrets of Snupperton Mumsley. Quirky villagers, quaint cottages and an intriguing mystery told in the voice of a highly unusual protagonist with a rapier wit combine for a delightful reading experience. While Simon's vampire blood may run cold, he is warm and human. This light-hearted series debut makes one glad vampires can live forever. Agent, Nancy Yost.

Yet one of the most important stories in America's struggle to overcome ethnic and religious hatred has gone largely untold. From the Depression to the late 1960s Jewish organizations&#x2015;working as the leaders in a broadly based social and political movement&#x2015;waged a determined campaign to eliminate all forms of discrimination and prejudice from American society. <br><br>Stuart Svonkin delves into the archival records of America's three major Jewish defense groups&#x2015;the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, and the American Jewish Congress&#x2015;to offer the first comprehensive account of organized Jewish political activism against bigotry and for human rights. <i>Jews Against Prejudice</i> chronicles American Jewry's political ascendance, from the era before World War II, when Jewish defense groups first organized to fight mass anti-Semitism, to their emergence as the leaders of a liberal movement determined to address the nation's most pressing political and social problems. <br><br>Svonkin explores the impact that these Jewish groups had in the fight against racial and ethnic stereotypes. Beginning in World War II Jewish social scientists and other intellectuals began a concentrated effort to investigate the social and psychological bases of prejudicial attitudes, outlooks, and behavior. By the end of the war these social scientists became convinced that all forms of prejudice, including anti-Semitism, shared the same social and psychological causes, which, if discovered, could be successfully treated and eliminated. For over twenty years Jewish intellectuals and activists worked hand in hand to formulate practical programs to combat prejudice. They pioneered tactics&#x2015;including educational programs in the schools, appeals for tolerance broadcast through the mass media, and legal challenges in the courts&#x2015;that remain among the principal weapons of today's civil rights activists. <br><br>Svonkin shows how ideology and the shifting models of prejudice greatly influenced the means that each Jewish group used in its fight against bigotry and racism. <br><br>He considers the far-reaching effects of anticommunism in the 1950s and early 1960s, when Jewish political groups moved to support liberal anticommunism as well as to oppose the demagoguery of such figures as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the leaders of the John Birch Society. Exploring the tensions between American and Jewish identities, Svonkin argues that the revelations of the Eichmann Trial, the growing concern over Israel's security, and the persistence of anti-Semitism all shaped Jewish activism&#x2015; driving the shift from the universalistic liberalism of the 1940s and 1950s to the cultural assertion and political neoconservatism of the late 1960s.</p><p>This vital contribution to the story of civil rights in modern America traces the political evolution of Jewish defense organizations from their initial incarnations as groups concerned primarily with defending American Jews against the virulent anti-Semitism of the 1920s and 1930s to their leading role in the fight against all forms of prejudice during the middle half of this century.Set against the backdrop of some of twentieth-century America&#39;s most divisive issues - bigotry, anticommunism, and cultural survival - Jews Against Prejudice traces the political evolution of Jewish defense organizations from their initial incarnations as groups concerned primarily with defending American Jews against the virulent anti-Semitism of the 1920s and 1930s to their leading role in the fight against all forms of prejudice during the middle-half of this century. The absorbing story of American Jewry&#39;s courageous campaign for tolerance - and the shifting conceptions of prejudice that drove it - is a landmark addition to the literature on civil rights in U.S. history.</p><h2>If On A Winter&#39;S Night...Roni Horn</h2><p>To enter Roni Horn&#39;s realm requires courage. But you only become aware of this after the fact, when it&#39;s already too late to back away, to erase the ever-repeating images from your mind. Attracted by the endless pictures of water or blurring images of clouds and clowns, seduced by dozens of young girl faces and pairs of eyes, you enter her realm somewhat unsuspectingly. And then the lock clicks behind you, almost silently, and you are standing all alone in front of a work that upon closer inspection suddenly seems rather dry and reserved, perhaps even repetitive. But somehow you know it&#39;s not. In this volume Elisabeth Lebovici, Bell Hooks, Thierry de Duve, Urs Stahel, Paolo Herkenhoff and Barbara Kruger contribute essays on the elusive work of Roni Horn. Through their essays begins a dialogue with a work that at first seems eloquent because of its sequential polyphony, but grows increasingly complex with the realization that it breaks almost immediately with any suggested narratives.</p><p></p><h2>Precision Pool, 2nd Edition</h2><p><p>Sharpen your strategy and shot-making skills!

Auclair's city is a succession of cheerfully colored, softly delineated scenes: a man with a parrot waits by the fruit and vegetable stand; a sidewalk artist chalks up a tropical garden; a neatly dressed violinist serenades passers-by. The text consists only of key phrases (from "Good-bye, Mommy" to "Beautiful!" to "My school"), which are also translated into Spanish and Japanese and transliterated for English speakers. Why Spanish and Japanese? Presumably these are the languages of the girl's parents, but Auclair's pictures skirt the issue, never clarifying the various characters' races. It's as if author and artist raise the question of race and then say it doesn't matter--a good answer, perhaps, but too subtle to lend coherence to this tale.

Here are juxtaposed the voices of Soviet and American citizens, some famous (Elliott Roosevelt, Gheorghi Arbatov), many unknown, recalling in vivid detail what life was like during the war years. Their stories, supplemented by dozens of rare photographs from Soviet and American archives, draw a vibrant portrait of both the battlefronts and the homefronts, illuminating the war's complex legacy in the relations between our two countries.<br> Inspired by a U.S.-Soviet television exchange, <em>Remembering War</em> offers an unprecedented dialogue among Soviets and Americans, who present recollections of both shared and contrasting experiences, of mutual respect and distrust. A Soviet woman recalls how she and other teenage girls formed their own combat unit, and an American woman pilot tells of ferrying fighter planes to the Soviet air force. Civilians present the sharp contrasts between the two home fronts, and soldiers from both armies remember the famous meeting on the Elbe. Numerous striking photographs capture the drama and poignancy of these moments. These voices and images remind us that only a few years before McCarthyism, Russian War Relief was the most popular charity in America, and the Red Army marched with American supplies.<br> The book also captures the bitter reality of war and the tensions between the two allies. Soviets such as writer Grigory Baklanov voice deep resentment at long delays in the allied invasion of France, and Americans detail and criticize Moscow's secrecy and paranoia. For the first time, Soviets discuss Stalin's actions, the secret protocols of the Soviet-Nazi pact of 1939, and other controversial aspects of their involvement in the war. Many of the photos offer chilling testimony to the horrors of the war, matched by bleak accounts from the survivors of Stalingrad.<br> In <em>Remembering War</em>, Soviet commentator Vladimir Pozner and American producer and professor Helene Keyssar (key figures in the television exchange) have produced a truly remarkable book, a unique reminder of the stark contrasts and forgotten unity in our wartime experiences. Published simultaneously in the U.S. and the Soviet Union, it offers a powerful exploration of the war's legacy and a testament to a renewed spirit of cooperation.</p><p><br><em>About the Authors:</em><br> <strong>Vladimir Pozner</strong> is a noted commentator in the Soviet media, and is the author of <em>Illusions</em>. <strong>Helene Keyssar</strong> is Professor of Communication at the University of California, San Diego, and is the author of several books, including <em>New Roots for the Nation</em>.<br>Though the United States and the Soviet Union were allies in World War II, their experiences could hardly have been more different. This work, the first of its kind, is based on a live television program jointly produced by Soviets and Americans in 1985. For the printed version the participants expanded their contributions, and an extensive historical framework has been added. Keyssar and Pozner bring neither new material nor fresh insight to the narratives. With fewer than 25 interviewees, their work can do no more than begin surveying the human aspects of U.S.-Soviet interaction between 1941 and 1945. The accounts, however, cover a broad spectrum of subjects: home fronts and fighting fronts, images of war, Nazi atrocities, and the 1945 meeting at the Elbe. They successfully generate an appetite for more--an appetite likely to be well satisfied should glasnost and perestroika continue. Useful for general collections on World War II.<br><i>- Dennis E.

A succession of bizarre evolutionary specimens have come and gone -- from walking whales to sabre-toothed cats -- yet many of these magnificent creatures have never been visualized before. Now, for the first time, spectacular and unfamiliar animals are recreated and set in the context of their world. Walking with Prehistoric Beasts reveals the extraordinary ancestors of modern mammals and the arrival of man, bringing to life the roots of our heritage. Following on from the hugely-acclaimed Walking with Dinosuars, Walking with Prehistoric Beasts recreates the creatures and landscapes of post-dinosaur Earth; transporting us to the icy plains of the mammoth, dark forests stalked by giant carnivorous birds, and deserts dominated by 16 ton Indricotheres. From the tiny fruit-eating primate Apidium, to the powerful chalicotheres, whose curved claws forced them to walk on their knuckles, the lives of these little known creatures are vividly brought to life. Meet the bizarre hose-nosed Macrauchenia, and the Deodicurus, a giant armadillo with a spiked club for a tail; run with cat-sized horses and rhino-sized carnivorous pigs, hunt with the skull-crushing Andrewsarchus, and walk with the very first humans. Illustrated boxes describe the latest scientific evidence that led to the reconsturctions of these creatures, while character boxes provide information on behavior and habitats. The text is illustrated throughout with ground-breaking computer graphic images to offer a unique record of lost worlds never seen before and reveal many of the most spectacular periods in Earth&#39;s history. Also available, accompanying the Walking with Prehistoric Beasts TV series, are books for children, home videos, a DVD, and a CD of the soundtrack from the series.</p><p>Tim Haines joined the Nature program at the BBC TV Natural History Unit in 1987 before moving to BBC TV Science.

All evidence of the environmental havoc left by this event has been erased from the Earth&#39;s surface. This is the Eocene or &#39;dawn of new times&#39; The Earth is now a forest planet -- a lush green paradise covered in tropical and sub-tropical jungle. Sea levels are high, as are global temperatures -- you could swim in the Arctic Sea. Magnolias and fig trees thrive in Alaska, elm and beech forests in Siberia, and in Germany lianas wrap themselves round mighty swamp cypresses. The spread of flowering plants that started in the time of the dinosaurs has continued and the tropical forests are now full of fruit, flowers and scents and the insects that evolved to exploit the flowers continue to thrive. Among the larger vertebrates, however, there is a hangover from the age of the dinosaurs. No large predator has evolved to replace the giant marine reptiles and on land mammals have not been quick to occupy the vacant niches. Instead it is crocodiles that hunt along the waterways and huge predatory birds that comb the forests for prey. But mammals are better prepared for the future. They have stayed small and have begun to diversify. Among a range of fur balls on the heavily forested islands that make up Eocene Europe, there are the first primates, rodents, hoofed plant-eaters, carnivores and some have even taken to the air -- the bats. 5 a.m.: The Quiet Time The Eocene jungle is very still just before sunrise. Around a dark lake the forest stacks up in dense green layers washed with an opaque pre-dawn light. A few large bats flap silently between the upper branches, making their way back to their roosts. The hum from insects seems muted and the occasional haunting screech from a primate in the canopy only emphasizes the silence. Suddenly ripples spread across the surface of the lake and waves appear from nowhere. There is a low rumble, which sends birds squawking from their roosts and mammals scuttling through the undergrowth. A series of huge bubbles erupts from the lake, producing a small, sickly white cloud of gas. Beneath it the water stains red. Then it is over -- a short earthquake that leaves the denizens of the forest jumpy but unharmed. Tremors are common here because the lake sits on a large island in the middle of the western Tethys Sea. To the north lies the giant Eurasian continent and to the south Africa is slowly drifting north, squeezing the Tethys in between and causing volcanic activity across the area. The lake itself is the reason for the bubbles and gas. This is its dark secret. It is about 2 kilometres across and more than 200 metres deep in places. At the very bottom is a dense layer of cold water trapped under a thick layer of warmer water. The cold water is stagnant and full of dissolved carbon dioxide. Every so often gas levels build up to such an extent that, when a tremor mixes the two layers, it can trigger the release of clouds of suffocating carbon dioxide which drift towards the shore. This all makes the lake a very dangerous neighbour. On this morning the cloud released is small, but its effects are deadly. A bat swoops low over the water, plucking a caddis fly out of the air, but as it turns it heads into the cloud of gas. After a few metres its delicate wings crumple and it drops with a small plop into the water. As the cloud reaches the reed and lily beds on the eastern shore it is already beginning to disperse. A palaeotis bird sitting on her nest opens her beak in a silent scream as she is suddenly robbed of oxygen. She shakes her head vigorously and staggers to her feet. Before the cloud can finish the job, it is carried on into the fern and palm stands beyond on the morning breeze. The palaeotis puffs her dark brown plumage and settles back on her nest a little confused. The cloud finally disperses as the ground rises. Here, where the understorey thins beneath huge laurel trees, the leaf litter has been scraped into a huge mound and topped with sticks and branches. Sitting on top of this, making a strange throaty whistle as she sleeps, is a gastornis. She is the largest bird on Earth, a carnivorous giant about 2 metres tall, with a stout, muscular body. She cannot fly, but instead ambushes her prey amongst the dense undergrowth. In the dim light the shape of her huge body is hard to make out under her speckled black feathers, but there is no mistaking her livid red features and pale beak. The beak, in particular, is an awesome sight -- a thick hatchet-shaped weapon that can snap the backbone of a small horse in one bite. She is queen of the jungle. The gastornis was undisturbed by the tremor and oblivious to the gas cloud. She is a day-time hunter and slumbers through the night, stirring only at dawn. All around her in the forest other diurnal creatures sleep on, unaware of the close brush some have had with death. 6 a.m.: A Dawn Start Sunrise and, because of rain in the night, the forest begins to steam. High in the canopy a thick mist hangs between the trees, tinged orange by the dawn light. Lower down, the branches and leaves splinter the light into rays that pierce through the dark forest floor. A little distance from the lake a huge strangler fig stands lashed to the ground by its web of branches. Deep inside the laurel tree it originally grew on has long since been killed. This makes a perfect shelter for a mother leptictidium and her two babies. Her nest is raised well off the ground, dry and the entrance protected by an impossible maze of fig roots. Inside the family are preparing for their morning hunt. Leptictidium are creatures of habit and the day always starts with a frantic washing session. The mother&#39;s long pink nose twitches as she works methodically over her soft brown fur. As she shifts to an inspection of her long hopping feet her youngsters play with her naked tail. After one of them nips it, she stops grooming and scrambles out into the moist morning air. The youngsters follow obediently. Leptictidium are common in this forest and several different species can be seen bounding through the undergrowth after insects and lizards. This mother belongs to the largest species, measuring almost a metre from her nose to the tip of her tail. She pauses for a moment to sniff for danger and then bounces off through the fig roots. On its branch an owl puffs up its long ribbon-like plumage and watches them go. All leptictidium have a hunting trail that they follow through the undergrowth. Every morning and every evening they work their way round the trail catching food and clearing any obstacle that falls across their path. Should a predator ambush them these trails become their escape routes. Today they will be used well. The three little mammals move swiftly through the steamy forest floor bouncing on their long back legs. The trail takes them down towards the lake and on to a small silt beach. The mother stops for a moment and then snaps at a large stag beetle on a log. She holds the wriggling insect firmly in her hands, while her sharp teeth make short work of it. The two youngsters gather round to taste the food from her lips. It is just two weeks since they were born and they are already being weaned. They must learn quickly how to hunt for themselves. Their progress slows as they near the lake ,with the mother finding more insects on which to feed. The trail also takes them along the top of the beach and, in this more exposed environment, the mother stops frequently to check for danger. There is a quiet in the air and her nose and whiskers quiver nervously. It turns out her caution is justified. A brief flash of red in a nearby tea bush is followed the snap of a branch and the female gastornis bursts from her hiding place. In three strides she is on her prey, snatching at them with resounding cracks of her huge beak. But the leptictidium started moving the moment the mother saw the flash of red and, bounding at full pelt, they just escape the lethal beak. With astonishing speed they head back up their trail through the fig roots and into the safety of their nest. The gastornis is left standing and, after a couple more strides, she loses interest in the hunt. She is too big to be a pursuit predator here; she relies more on ambush amid the dense forest. The gastornis turns and struts down to the lake shore. With a low mist swirling round her clawed feet, her black speckled plumage and her menacing red-stained face, her distinguished ancestry is clear. She is a return to the age of carnivorous therapod dinosaurs, giant killers that once stalked the land on two legs. But in this new age she is a creature out of time. There are many other predators around, such as walking crocodiles and small but powerful creodont mammals. The gastornis is the biggest of all of them, but in contrast to the time of the dinosaurs there are no giant herbivores for her to feast on. She has to work hard for her living. The giant lets out a long rasping call that echoes round the still dark lake and harks back to a lost time. 9 a.m.: End of the First Shift By mid morning the mist is long gone and the combination of high sun and dense greenery makes the air stiflingly humid. The forest here is typical of the tropical jungle that swathes most of this warm planet. The flowering plants that only started their evolution towards the end of the time of the dinosaurs are now dominant. Although a few ferns and cypresses hold on, the canopy is full of laurel, walnut, beeche palm and dogwood. Climbers such as grapevines honeysuckles and moonseeds wrap round these trees, while below magnolias, mulberries, tea and citrus bushes fight for light. The variety on display is bewildering, but the things that would really confuse a time-travelling dinosaur are the colours and the smells. The jungle is full of flowers and fruits, and in the morning heat their scent is overpowering. The green and brown dinosaur world of ferns and conifer needles has gone for ever. This seismic change in the flora is reflected in the type of animals that thrive here. The canopy is abuzz with wasps and bees. Among the branches and on the ground small mammals and birds grow fat on a diet of large fruit and soft flowers -- gone is most of the rough, resin-filled fare on which dinosaur plant eaters had to survive. This is a new Eden, a colorful scented world full of small animals -- completely different from the age of the dinosaurs. Under the canopy the darkness is broken by patches of magnesium-white light, where the sun breaks through to the forest floor. A timid propalaeotherium horse tugs at a moonseed illuminated by one such ray of light. He is keen to draw it into the shadows where his dark dappled back will provide the secuirty of camouflage. A scuffle at the edge of the clearing sends the propalaeotherium scampering off into the camellias. The leptictidium mother bounces into the clearing and stops to wrestle with a lizard she has just caught. The two youngsters catch up and tug at the unfortunate reptile. Suddenly the lizard&#39;s brightly coloured tail pops off and starts to thrash about among the leaves. The youngsters leap back, pause and then pursue the tail with a series of hunting moves they have seen their mother perform. She meanwhile holds tightly onto the lizard&#39;s body and, after a firm bite to the back of the neck, it goes limp in her hands. She then heads off again for the nest. The youngsters follow, abandoning the tail to flick around by itself in the clearing. It is the end of the leptictidiums&#39; morning hunt and the family disappear under the strangler fig for their midday sleep. Inside the nest the mother finishes eating the lizard -- although the youngsters will learn to hunt from her, she will never kill prey for them. They continue to try to suckle, but she is rapidly losing patience. Their time within her nest is running out -- they will soon have to learn to be independent For now, however, they all curl up and go to sleep. Down by the lake, swifts dart across the surface, striking at the columns of mating insects. A python slips through the water lilies, heading for shore to digest a baby crocodile it has just caught. Nearby a much larger wake also heads for the shore. Just before it reaches the bank there is a splash and the top of a long brown head pops out of the water. At a glance it could be mistaken for a large crocodile, since there are plenty of those in the lake. But a closer look reveals that it is covered in a layer of fur and that there are whiskers bristling round its dark nose. Its eyes scan the bank and then, as it draws itself out onto the silt, it becomes clear that this extraordinary beast is nothing like a crocodile. Thick short hair covers its entire body and large webbed feet make it move awkwardly on land. This is a male ambulocetus, part of a bizarre group of mammals that have evolved to take advantage of similar niche to crocodiles, hunting animals along the water&#39;s edge. They evolved on the Eurasian coast to the east of this forest and it is very rare to see one on the European islands However, the jungle round the lake is full of bite-sized prey, so the ambulocetus should not be short of food. This male is about 4 metres long, not quite fully grown. He slides into position, half in and half out of the water, in a patch of sedge that disguises his body. Then he settles down and waits. The ambulocetus&#39;s hunting method requires a lot of patience. They have developed a special jaw and ear apparatus that is very sensitive to vibration. By resting their head on the ground they can sense the approach of prey and time their attack perfectly. Unfortunately, this does mean they have to wait for their victims to come to them. In the oppressive heat of mid-morning the ambulocetus starts his unique vigil. A huge flying ant lands on his forehead and explores the drying fur round his neck, but he does not move. After about half an hour a propalaeotherium appears from the undergrowth. She stands motionless in the shadows, her ears twitching. Then she nervously picks her way down to the lake to drink. Every few sips she looks around, alert to the slightest moves that would betray a predator. She is drinking just 2 metres from the stationary ambulocetus, but that is still too far for his purposes. Only when a large splash amongst the lilies sends the little horse jumping back does the predator make his move. With a flurry of dust and leaves, a huge fang-filled mouth slashes sideways. But the horse was never near enough and, leaping high into the air, she disappears off into the jungle. The ambulocetus decides to abandon his hunting, as the daytime temperatures are getting too high. He turns and slips into the water. After pushing off from the shore, a few sweeps of his webbed feet bring him to the deep, dark water that occupies most of the lake. Then his body and short tail fall into a series of slow, up-and-down undulations that propel him through the water without the use of his limbs. This movement is very distinctive of these new semi-aquatic mammals and will one day be the trademark of their descendants, the whales. Below the ambulocetus, a crocodile moves past, its tail beating from side to side. The two do not bother each other. 12 noon: The Swarming In the direct sunlight the temperature continues to climb into the blistering 40s but under the shade of the canopy it peaks in the lower 30s. In their strangler-fig nest the leptictidium no longer lie bundled together: instead they are stretched out, breathing fast to keep cool. Beneath the laurel with its massive buttressed roots, the gastornis has returned to her nest. In the centre lies a single large blue-green egg which she has been incubating for weeks. Today for the first time it is making a noise. With her fearsome beak she gently turns it, revealing a small hole worked by the chick as it starts...</p><h2>Conversations With Isaiah Berlin</h2><p>The philosopher, intellectual historian, and proponent of liberal thinking recounts his life, interspersing personal reminiscences with a discussion of the great thinkers who influenced and intrigued him--from Machiavelli to Pasternak.</p><p>RAMIN JAHANBEGLOO Born 1956, Iran.

In 1921 his family moved to England. Educated at St Paul&#39;s School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Thereafter he remained at Oxford, where he held Fellowships at All Souls College and New College, and became Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory (1957-67) and first President of Wolfson College (1966-75). He was President of the British Academy from 1974 to 1978. He died in Oxford in November 1997. During the Second World War he was sent by the FO to New York (1941); Washington (1942 - 1946), Moscow (1945-6. He received many honorary degrees as well as the Erasmus , Lippincott, Jerusalem and Agnelli Prizes.What began as an interview of the noted British philosopher and historian of ideas, conducted by the Iranian philosopher Jahanbegloo for the journal Esprit , grew into a series of five conversations, comprising a sort of intellectual memoir. They range over Berlin's writings on historicism, pluralism, and liberty as well as the ideas of thinkers such as Vico, Herder, and Herzen. Berlin also speaks of his many friends and acquaintances among the important thinkers and artists of the 20th century. Both urbane and opinionated, these conversations provide an able introduction to Berlin's thought that ultimately sends us back to his many books and essays.

Eddy built the church from a fringe sect into a mainstream religion whose wealth and power exceeded that of many Protestant denominations in the mid-20th century--and were considerably augmented by the church's once-popular newspaper, the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>. <p> Fraser, a literary critic and poet who was raised a Christian Scientist, has a relentless analytic bent and an acute eye for physical detail, both of which are in evidence on every page of this book. Her stories of parents whose attempts at faith-healing resulted in their children's deaths are especially poignant. These stories also illuminate and analyze the fears and pains that have plagued many Christian Scientists who subscribe to Eddy's belief that individuals can control their physical destiny by force of faith. Ultimately, Fraser has little sympathy for the obdurate self-reliance advocated by Christian Scientist doctrine, which she sees as a forerunner to the extremist paranoia of contemporary cults. "The suggestibility, infatuation, and enthusiasm that sparked Christian Science ... lies behind our current anxious fixations on imaginary perils and medical conspiracies," Fraser writes. "Florid though they may seem, such fears can have far from imaginary consequences." </p><p> The goal of Fraser's book is to track down and annihilate irrational fears in the religion of her childhood; her reason for doing so, however, exudes an undeniably spiritual grace: "Should we continue to pursue [these fears], our providences will surely grow ever more remarkable." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>Millions of Americans--from Lady Astor to Carol Burnett, Ginger Rogers to H.

Orson Scott Card is the bestselling author best known for the classic Ender&#39;s Game, Ender&#39;s Shadow and other novels in the Ender universe.</p><p>In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race's next attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as soldiers. A brilliant young boy, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin lives with his kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn't make the cut--young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.<p> Ender's skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. Back on Earth, Peter and Valentine forge an intellectual alliance and attempt to change the course of history.</p><p> This futuristic tale involves aliens, political discourse on the Internet, sophisticated computer games, and an orbiting battle station. Yet the reason it rings true for so many is that it is first and foremost a tale of humanity; a tale of a boy struggling to grow up into someone he can respect while living in an environment stripped of choices. <i>Ender's Game</i> is a must-read book for science fiction lovers, and a key conversion read for their friends who "don't read science fiction."</p><p> <i>Ender's Game</i> won both the Hugo and the Nebula the year it came out. Writer Orson Scott Card followed up this honor with the first-time feat of winning both awards again the next year for the sequel, <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>. <i>--Bonnie Bouman</i></p><p><b><em>A Reading Guide for Ender's Game.</em> </b></p> <p><b>THE ENDER UNIVERSE</b></p> <p><b>Ender's Series</b>: Ender Wiggin: The finest general the world could hope to find or breed. </p> <p> The following Ender's Series titles are listed in order: Ender's Game, Ender In Exile, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind.</p> <p><b>Ender's Shadow Series</b>: Parallel storylines to <i>Ender&#x2019;s Game</i> from Bean: Ender&#x2019;s right hand, his strategist, and his friend. </p> <p> The following Ender's Shadow Series titles are listed in order: Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant, Shadows in Flight.</p> <p><b>The First Formic War Series</b>: One hundred years before <i>Ender's Game</i>, the aliens arrived on Earth with fire and death.

He also argues that design should be primarily concerned with the self-identified and clearly specified needs and preferences of the users. He presents here a progress report on his forty years of work on the development of new tools and procedures necessary for the implementation of this approach in environmental design and behavioral research.<p>Theil describes a user-oriented participatory process of environmental planning, design, and management. Named "envirotecture," it identifies and profiles the prospective users and flow-charts their proposed activities on site, in the context of their day. It then employs a representative sample of these users as consultants for the formulation of "experiential performance specifications" as part of the project program. Design development then proceeds with reference to the responses of these user-consultants to alternative designs in the form of simulated environmental sequences.</p><p>After construction, users' experiences are monitored as a function of facility management. Comparison of these realized experiences with the predesign experiential performance specifications then provides a valid measure of design and managerial competence. Envirotecture thus offers designers an opportunity to achieve greater social significance in their contributions to the public domain. It also provides a means for the long-overdue development of empirical theories of design, in conjunction with the work of researchers in environment and behavior studies.</p><p>This book brings together a social awareness, a knowledge of environmental perception and cognition, and an operational design method in an unprecedented synthesis. It focuses on the central and critical concerns of socially responsible designers, as well as on the interests of researchers in environmental psychology, sociology, and anthropology.</p></p><p></p><h2>Queen of Fire (Raven&#39;s Shadow)</h2><p>1st UK Signed Limited ed. 1/100 Signed and numbered by the author on the title page.

Standing tall as always, angular features turned towards the horizon, his cloak wrapped tight against the seaward chill. My initial puzzlement at finding him here faded as I caught sight of the ship leaving the harbour, a narrow-hulled vessel of Meldenean design, sent to the Northern Reaches with an important passenger, one I knew he would miss greatly.</i></p><p><i>He turned to regard my approach, a tight, wary smile on his lips, and I realised he had lingered to witness my own departure. Our interactions since the relief of Alltor had been brief, somewhat terse in truth, distracted as he was by the ceaseless tumult of war and whatever malady had plagued him in the aftermath of his already legendary charge. The fatigue that turned his once-strong features into a sagging mask of red-eyed lethargy and his strident if coarse voice into a droning rasp. It had faded now, I could see. Recent battle seemed to have restored him somehow, making me wonder if he found some form of sustenance in blood and horror.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; he greeted me with a sketch of a formal bow then nodded at my prisoner. &#x201c;My lady.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>Fornella returned the nod but gave no response, regarding him without expression as the salt-tinged wind tossed her hair, a single streak of grey visible amidst the reddish brown tumult.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I have already received ample instruction&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I began but Al Sorna waved a hand.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I come to offer no instruction, my lord,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Merely a farewell and my best wishes for your endeavour.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I watched his expression as he waited for a response, the wary smile smaller now, his black eyes guarded. </i>Can it be? <i>I wondered. </i>Is he seeking forgiveness?</p><p><i>&#x201c;Thank you, my lord,&#x201d; I replied, hefting the heavy canvas bag to my shoulder. &#x201c;But we have a ship to board before the morning tide.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Of course. I&#x2019;ll accompany you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need a guard,&#x201d; Fornella said, her tone harsh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve given my word, tested by your truth-teller.&#x201d; It was true, we walked alone this morning without escort or formality. The reborn court of the Unified Realm had little time or inclination for ceremony.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Indeed, Honoured Citizen,&#x201d; Al Sorna replied in clumsy and heavily accented Volarian. &#x201c;But I have&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. words for this grey-clad.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Free man,&#x201d; I corrected before switching to Realm Tongue. &#x201c;Grey-clad denotes financial rather than social status.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Ah, quite so, my lord.&#x201d; He stepped aside and gestured for me to continue along the wharf to the quay where the ships waited, a long line of Meldenean war galleys and traders. Naturally, our vessel was moored at the farthest end of the line.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Brother Harlick&#x2019;s gift?&#x201d; he enquired, nodding at the bag I carried.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Fifteen of the oldest books in the Great Library, those I could identify as useful in the small time allowed in his archives.&#x201d; In truth I had expected some argument from the brother librarian when I made my request, but the man had simply given an affable nod and barked an imperious order at one of his attendants to gather the requisite scrolls from the wagons that served as his movable library. I knew his apparent indifference to this theft was at least partly derived from his gift; he could always simply pen fresh copies, and openly since the need to keep such things hidden had disappeared. The Dark, as they called it, now revealed and discussed openly, the Gifted free to practice their talents without fear of swift torment and execution, at least in theory. I could see the lingering fear on the faces of those not so talented, and the envy, making me wonder if perhaps the wisest course would have been to keep the Gifted in the shadows. But could shadows ever linger in the fires of war?</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You really think he&#x2019;s in there somewhere?&#x201d; Al Sorna asked as we walked towards the ship. &#x201c;The Ally?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;An influence so malign and powerful is bound to leave traces,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A historian is a hunter, my lord. Seeking out signs in the undergrowth of correspondence and memoir, tracking prey via the spoor of memory. I don&#x2019;t expect to find a complete and unbiased history of this thing, be it beast or man or neither. But it will have left traces, and I intend to hunt it down.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Then you should have a care, for I suspect it will not be blind to your attentions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Nor yours.&#x201d; I paused, glancing at his profile, seeing a troubled brow. </i>Where is your certainty? <i>I thought. It had been one of his most aggravating traits during our previous association; the implacable, unshakeable surety. Now there was just a grim and troubled man weighed down by the prospect of trials to come.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Taking the capital will not be easy,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The wisest course would be to wait here, gathering strength until the spring.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Wisdom and war are rare bedfellows, my lord. And you&#x2019;re right, the Ally will most likely see it all.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Then why&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;We cannot simply linger here and wait for the next blow to fall. Any more than your Emperor can expect to remain immune from the Ally&#x2019;s attentions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I am fully aware of what message to deliver to the Emperor.&#x201d; The leather satchel bearing the sealed scroll was heavy about my neck, heavier even than my bag of books, though only a fraction of its weight. </i>Just ink, paper and wax,<i> I thought.</i> Yet it could send millions to war.</p><p><i>We halted as we came to the ship, a broad-beamed Meldenean trader, her planking still scorched from the Battle of the Teeth, rails bearing the scars of blades and arrowheads, patches on the sails furled to the rigging. My eyes were also drawn to the serpentine figurehead which, despite having lost much of its lower jaw, retained a certain familiarity. My gaze found the captain at the head of the gangplank, thick arms crossed, his face set in a glower, a face I recalled all too well.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Did you, perhaps, have a hand in choosing this vessel, my lord?&#x201d; I asked Al Sorna.</i></p><p><i>There was a faint glimmer of amusement in his gaze as he shrugged. &#x201c;Merely a coincidence, I assure you.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I sighed, finding I had scant room in my heart for yet more resentment, turning to Fornella and extending a hand to the ship. &#x201c;Honoured Citizen. I&#x2019;ll join you in a moment.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I saw Al Sorna&#x2019;s eyes track her as she walked the plank to the ship, moving with her customary grace born of centuries-long practice. &#x201c;Despite what the truth-teller said,&#x201d; he told me, &#x201c;I caution you, don&#x2019;t trust her.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I was her slave long enough to learn that lesson myself.&#x201d; I hefted my bag once again and nodded a farewell. &#x201c;By your leave, my lord. I look forward to hearing the tale of your campaign&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You were right,&#x201d; he broke in, his wary smile returned once more. &#x201c;The story I told you. There were some&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. omissions.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;I think you mean lies.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; His smile faded. &#x201c;But I believe you have earned the truth. I have scant notion of how this war will end, or even if either of us will live to see its end. But if we do, find me again and I promise you&#x2019;ll have nothing but truth from me.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I should have been grateful, I know. For what scholar does not hunger for truth from one such as he? But there was no gratitude as I looked into his gaze, no thought save a name. </i>Seliesen.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I used to wonder,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;how a man who had taken so many lives could walk the earth unburdened by guilt. How does a killer bear the weight of killing and still call himself human? But we are both killers now, and I find it burdens my soul not at all. But then, I killed an evil man, and you a good one.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>I turned away and strode up the gangplank without a backward glance.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Lyrna</p><p>She was woken by the snow. Soft, icy caresses on her skin, tingling and not unpleasant, calling her from the darkness. It took a moment for memory to return and when it did she found it a fractured thing, fear and confusion reigning amidst a welter of image and sensation. <i>Iltis roaring as he charged, sword bared&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The ring of steel&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A hard fist across her mouth&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And the man&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The man who burned her.</i></p><p>She opened her mouth to scream but could issue no more than a whimper, her subsequent gasp dragging chilled air into her lungs. It seemed as if she would freeze from the inside out and she felt it strange she should die from cold after being burned so fiercely.</p><p><i>Iltis!</i> The name was a sudden shout in her mind. <i>Iltis is wounded! Perhaps dead!</i></p><p>She willed herself to move, to get up, call for a healer with all the power her queen&#x2019;s voice could muster. Instead she barely managed to groan and flutter her hands a little as the snow continued its frosty caress. Rage burned in her, banishing the chill from her lungs. <i>I need to move! I will not die in the snow like a forgotten dog! </i>Drawing jagged air into her lungs again she screamed, putting every ounce of strength and rage into the sound. A fierce scream, a queen&#x2019;s scream&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but no more than a rattle of air through teeth when it reached her ears, along with something else.</p><p>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. better be a good reason for this, Sergeant,&#x201d; a hard voice was saying, strong, clipped and precise. A soldier&#x2019;s voice, accompanied by the crunch of boots in snow.</p><p>&#x201c;Tower Lord said he was to be minded well, Captain,&#x201d; another voice, coloured by a Nilsaelin accent, older and not quite so strong. &#x201c;Treated with respect, he said. Like the other folk from the Point. And he seems fairly insistent, much as I can gather from a fellow that don&#x2019;t talk above two words at a time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Folk from the Point,&#x201d; the captain said in a softer tone. &#x201c;To whom we have to thank for a snowfall at summer&#x2019;s end&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; His voice faded and the crunch of boots became the tumult of running men.</p><p>&#x201c;Highness!&#x201d; Hands on her shoulders, soft but insistent. &#x201c;Highness! Are you hurt? Do you hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>Lyrna could only groan, feeling her hands flutter once more.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain Adal,&#x201d; the sergeant&#x2019;s voice, choked and broken by fear. &#x201c;Her face&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have eyes, Sergeant! Fetch the Tower Lord to Brother Kehlan&#x2019;s tent! And bring men to carry his lordship. Say nothing of the queen. You understand me?&#x201d;</p><p>More boots on the snow then she felt something warm and soft cover her from head to foot, her benumbed back and legs tingling as hands lifted her. She fell into darkness, untroubled by the jolting run of the captain as he bore her away.</p><p>� � �</p><p>He was there when she awoke the second time, her eyes tracking over a canvas roof to find him sitting beside the cot where they had placed her. Although his eyes were tinged with the same red haze she had seen the day before, his gaze was brighter now, focused, the black eyes seeming to bore into the skin of her face as he leaned forward. <i>He burned me&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>She closed her eyes and turned away from him, stilling the sob in her chest, swallowing and composing herself before she turned back, finding him kneeling beside the cot, head lowered.</p><p>&#x201c;Highness,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>She swallowed and tried to speak, expecting only a faint croak to emerge but surprising herself with a somewhat strident response. &#x201c;My lord Al Sorna. I trust the morning finds you well.&#x201d;</p><p>His head came up, the expression sharp, the black eyes still fierce. She wanted to tell him it was rude to stare, at a queen no less, but knew it would sound churlish. <i>Every word must be chosen,</i> her father had said once. <i>Each word spoken by the one who wears the crown will be remembered, often misremembered. So, my daughter, if ever you find this band of gold weighing upon your brow, never utter a single word that should not be heard from the mouth of a queen.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Quite&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, Highness,&#x201d; Vaelin responded, remaining on one knee as she stirred herself. To her surprise she found she could move easily. Someone had removed the dress and cloak she wore the night before, replacing the finery with a simple cotton shift that covered her from neck to ankle, the fabric pleasing on her skin as she sat and swung her legs off the cot to sit up. &#x201c;Please rise,&#x201d; she told Vaelin. &#x201c;I find ceremony tedious at the best of times, and of scant use when we&#x2019;re alone.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood, eyes never leaving her face. There was a hesitancy to his movements, a slight tremble to his hands as he reached for his chair, pulling it closer to sit opposite her, his face no more than an arm&#x2019;s length away, the closest they had been since that day at the Summertide Fair.</p><p>&#x201c;Lord Iltis?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Wounded but alive,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Also frostbitten in the small finger of his left hand. Brother Kehlan was obliged to take it off. He barely seemed to notice and it was quite the struggle to stop him charging forth to look for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I was fortunate in the friends fate contrived to place in my path.&#x201d; She paused, drawing breath and courage for what she had to say next. &#x201c;We had little chance to talk yesterday. I know you must have many questions.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One in particular. There are many wild tales abroad regarding your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. injuries. They say it happened when Malcius died.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Malcius was murdered, by Brother Frentis of the Sixth Order. I killed him for it.&#x201d;</p><p>She saw the shock hit home as if she had slashed him with an ice-cold blade. His gaze became distant as he slumped forward, speaking in a whisper. &#x201c;Wanna be a brother&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wanna be like you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There was a woman with him,&#x201d; Lyrna went on. &#x201c;Like your brother, playing the role of an escaped slave, come all the way across the ocean with a grand tale of adventure. From her reaction when I killed him, I suspect their bond was close. Love can drive us to extremes.&#x201d;</p><p>He closed his eyes, controlling his grief with a shudder. &#x201c;Killing him would not have been easy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My time with the Lonak left me skilled in certain areas. I saw him fall. After that&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; <i>The fire raked across her skin like the claws of a wildcat, filling her throat with the stench of her own flesh burning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>&#x201c;It seems my memory has some limits after all.&#x201d;</p><p>Vaelin sat in silence for what seemed an age, lost in thought, his face even more gaunt than before. &#x201c;It told me he was coming back,&#x201d; he murmured finally. &#x201c;But not for this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had expected you to request a different explanation,&#x201d; she said, keen to draw him back from whatever memories clouded his mind. &#x201c;For the way you were treated at Linesh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, Highness.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;I assure you I require no explanation at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The war was a grievous error.

Roberts contributed to her book <i>War on the Saints</i>, which was written to counter what she perceived as the excesses of the revival and the deceptions of Satan at work to prevent the true work of God in awakening. <i>War on the Saints</i> is considered a textbook on spiritual warfare by many Christians.

Is it revolutionary? Or a risky rebellion against running&#x2015;and teenage&#x2015;norms?</p><p>Coach Bill Aris has heard both, but one thing is indisputable. Everything Aris does with his runners&#x2015;male and female alike&#x2015;is new and extraordinary, and he has created a new American running dynasty. The cross-country runners of Fayetteville-Manlius, or F-M, in upstate New York have dominated high school running for 15 years, sweeping boys&#x2019; and girls&#x2019; titles at the Nike Cross Nationals championships (NXN) in 2014 in an unprecedented achievement.</p><p>The girls&#x2019; team, empowered by Aris&#x2019; unique, unwavering brand of gender equity, has won 11 of the last 13 NXN titles, some by margins of over 100 points. The boys&#x2019; team has the best cumulative national record of NXN podium performances. F-M domination has shocked the sport for its defiance of accepted running principles and limitations. One year at NXN, the F-M girls defeated the all-star field of top teams by an average of 59 seconds per girl in the 5k race.</p><p>Another year, the girls ran faster than their teenage Kenyan counterparts, who competed in the Portland, Oregon event as an international showcase. Across the country, coaches awed by F-M and unaware of the team&#x2019;s methods and discoveries, whispered, &#x201c;How do they <em>do</em> it?&#x201d;</p><p>From adopting long-forgotten &#x201c;Stotan&#x201d; creeds&#x2015;combining the rigors of a Spartan and stoic lifestyle&#x2015;to delving into teenage developmental psychology and gender-blindness in training, <em>Amazing Racers</em> is a must read for millions of runners and the millions more who strive for better performance.</p> 8 pages of color photographs</p><p>Marc Bloom&nbsp;is an award-winning track and field journalist. He was a senior writer for&nbsp;Runner's World&nbsp;magazine and is the author of ten books, including Run with the Champions&nbsp;and God on the Starting Line. &nbsp;He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.&#x201c;Bloom pulls back the curtain on this wondrous team.&nbsp; An illuminating narrative with cultural power and unflinching love.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Amby Burfoot</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Who would think that the story of an upstate New York high school coach and his young runners could be so inspiring! Marc Bloom gives us a beautiful exploration of the meaning of success in running&#x2015;and in life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Amazing Racers&nbsp;</em>tells us how we can perform at a higher level than we ever imagined.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George A. Hirsch, chairman of the New York Road Runners, a founder of the New York City Marathon, and former worldwide publisher of RUNNER'S WORLD</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bloom, the oracle of high school cross-country, gives Aris and the F-M team the treatment they merit given their astounding success.&nbsp; Bloom's attention to detail allows us to understand for the first time how Aris adapts his cherished 'Stotan' philosophy to create a culture of success.&nbsp; Bravo!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Craig Masback, former CEO, USA Track and Field, NBC-TV track and marathon commentator</strong><br><br>&#x201c;An engaging portrayal of an idiosyncratic coach, his stout-hearted athletes, and the wonder of powerful running.&nbsp; Marc effectively shows how a coach holds a mirror up to his harriers, pushing and pulling them to train with diligence, and how to find the freedom, beauty, and strength in their pursuits.&nbsp; Along the way, they discover truths about themselves and, best of all, a life-long love of running.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Lynn Jennings, three-time World Cross Country Champion and Olympic Bronze medalist</strong><br><br>&#x201c;An inspiring illumination of a sensational team. Bloom's consistent and sincerely awestruck tone drives home just how special this story is, celebrating both the dedicated young athletes and their leader. His close reading of races, often called in heart-racing play-by-plays, is supplemented by research in sports physiology and psychology, and the history of cross-country racing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bloom captures all the ingredients for a magical journey into why running remains such an integral part of the American experience.&nbsp; Bloom brings depth and dimension to this intimate and enthralling story.&nbsp; If running is part of your life psyche,&nbsp;<em>Amazing Racers&nbsp;</em>will only enhance that treasured lifeline.&nbsp;&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Neil Amdur, former NEW YORK TIMES sports editor and running corresopndent</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A captivating story of a longtime coach with a unique vision. Bravo to Bloom for sharing this story of a running dynasty and the man behind the program. A must-read for cross-country runners.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong></p><h2>For My Daughters</h2><p>On the eve of her seventieth birthday, Virginia St. Clair sets out to reunite her three estranged daughters--Caroline, a career-minded lawyer; social butterfly Leah; and Annette, a wife and mother--at her isolated Maine estate.

Platt, the author of Flower Crafts and owner of a flower and herb farm, devises a collection of elegant arrangements here, nearly any one of which would bring an air of festivity to any locale in any season. Her constructions range from the simple impact of a Della Robbia Wreath made with whole dried citrus fruits, artichokes and sala leaves, to wedding wreaths for a bride and her party, using dried flowers and herbs. There are also other theme wreaths for special occasions and such holidays as Valentine's Day and Halloween. The collection of Christmas-related arrangements includes one made with fresh greens, dried berries and flower heads that doubles as a bird buffet; another, named Ice and Snow, uses preserved juniper, pine cones, clusters of bleached baby's breath, white ribbons and plastic icicles; a traditional fresh wreath is composed of holly and ivy. Platt offers tips throughout (e.g., cheap ribbon will cheapen the entire effort) and gives precise, easy to follow instructions that make her book a boon for any season. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dreamwood</h2><p>Lucy Darrington has no choice but to run away from boarding school. Her father, an expert on the supernatural, has been away for <i>too</i> long while doing research in Saarthe, a remote territory in the Pacific Northwest populated by towering redwoods, timber barons, and the Lupine people. But upon arriving, she learns her father is missing: Rumor has it he&#x2019;s gone in search of dreamwood, a rare tree with magical properties that just might hold the cure for the blight that&#x2019;s ravaging the forests of Saarthe.<br><br>Determined to find her father (and possibly save Saarthe), Lucy and her vexingly stubborn friend Pete follow William Darrington&#x2019;s trail to the deadly woods on Devil&#x2019;s Thumb. As they encounter Lupine princesses, giant sea serpents, and all manner of terrifying creatures, Lucy hasn&#x2019;t reckoned that the dreamwood itself might be the greatest threat of all.</p><p>After an early job counting dead bugs in an entomology lab, <b>Heather Mackey</b> realized she was better at making up stories about imaginary science than practicing the real thing. She lives in Northern California&#x2014;with her husband and two kids&#x2014;where she&#x2019;s still perfecting the ultimate dance party playlist.&#x201c;In any of your stories is there an uncanny place?&#x201d; Lucy asked. &#x201c;Graveyards where people see ghosts, hollows where people hear voices even when no one&#x2019;s around?&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh ho.&#x201d; Anya chuckled. &#x201c;Stories like that are a penny a pound in Saarthe. But the stories your father most wanted to hear were about the Thumb.&#x201d;Lucy frowned at this. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;Anya pressed her floury hand onto the table. &#x201c;This here&#x2019;s Saarthe.&#x201d; She pointed to her palm and fingers. &#x201c;And this is Devil&#x2019;s Thumb.&#x201d;The cook&#x2019;s broad brown knuckle jutted out into the snowy white flour.&#x201c;Why is it the Devil&#x2019;s?&#x201d;Anya wiped her hands. Her eyes held Lucy&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s cursed.&#x201d;</p><h2>Locomotives in Detail 6: Maunsell Schools Class 4-4-0</h2><p>Widely considered to be the greatest locomotive design produced by Maunsell and often regarded as the finest 4-4-0 ever designed and built in Britain, the first of the 40-strong &#39;Schools&#39; class emerged from Eastleigh Works in 1930. Named after famous British public schools, the origin of the class was a requirement, following the development of the &#39;Lord Nelson&#39; and &#39;King Arthur&#39; classes, for a locomotive of similar performance for secondary services. Initially, Maunsell&#39;s idea was to create a smaller version of the &#39;Lord Nelson&#39; class. However, the new locomotives had to be able to run on the Tunbridge Wells to Hastings route. The restricted loading gauge imposed by a tunnel on this line precluded the use of a 4-6-0 and led to the building of a 4-4-0 instead. The distinctive shape of the cab of the &#39;Schools&#39; class engines was also necessitated by restrictions imposed by the loading gauge on this route The &#39;Schools&#39; class proved to be highly successful in service remaining in front line service until their withdrawal in 1961-62. In their latter years, members of the class were often used on Royal Train duties on the Southern Region, providing an immaculate spectacle to those who witnessed these services. On withdrawal, three were preserved. One of these initially was sent to the United States but has been subsequently repatriated to the United Kingdom. With the model railway market growing and with the proprietary manufacturers producing ever better and more finely-detailed models, the needs of the enthusiast and modeller for ever more detailed information grows in parallel. The titles already published in this series have sold well. This new volume on a much admired SR class will not prove to be an exception to this pattern.</p><p></p><h2>American History Revised: 200 Startling Facts That Never Made It Into the History Books</h2><p>This spirited re-examination of American history delves into our past to expose hundreds of startling facts that never made it into the textbooks, and highlights how little-known people and events played surprisingly influential roles in the great American story. We tend to think of history as settled, set in stone, but American History Revised reveals a past that is filled with ironies, surprises, and misconceptions. Living abroad for twelve years gave author Seymour Morris, Jr. the opportunity to view his country as an outsider and compelled him to examine American history from a fresh perspective. As Morris colorfully illustrates through the 200 historical vignettes that makes up this book, much of our nation&#39;s past is quite different--and far more remarkable--than we thought. We discover that: �In the 1950s Ford was approached by two Japanese companies begging for a joint venture. Ford declined their offers, calling them makers of &#34;tin cars.&#34; The two companies were Toyota and Honda. �Eleanor Roosevelt and most women&#39;s groups opposed the Equal Rights Amendment forbidding gender discrimination. �The two generals who ended the American Civil War weren&#39;t Grant and Lee. �The #1 bestselling American book of all time was written in one day. �The Dutch made a bad investment in buying Manhattan for $24. �Two young girls aimed some day to become First Lady--and succeeded. �Three times, a private financier saved the United States from bankruptcy. Organized into ten thematic chapters, American History Revised plumbs American history&#39;s numerous inconsistencies, twists, and turns to make it come alive again.</p><p></p><h2>Ayako</h2><p>Long considered as one of Osamu Tezuka&#x2019;s most political narratives, <i>Ayako </i>is also considered to be one of his most challenging as it defies the conventions of his manga by utilizing a completely original cast and relying solely on historical drama to drive the plot.&nbsp; Ayako, pulls no punches, and does not allow for gimmicks as science-fiction or fantasy may.&nbsp; Instead Tezuka weaves together a tale which its core simply focuses on a single family, a family that could be considered a metaphor for a rapidly developing superpower.<br><br>Overflowing with imagery of the cold war seen through Japan&#x2019;s eyes, Ayako is firmly set in realism taking inspiration from a number of historical events that occurred over the American occupation and the cultural-revolution which soon followed. Believed to be Tezuka&#x2019;s answer to the <i>gekiga</i> (dramatic comics) movement of the 60&#x2019;s, Ayako should be considered one of the better early examples of a <i>seinen</i> (young adult) narrative to be published.<br><br>Initially set in the aftermath of World War II, Ayako focuses its attention on the Tenge clan, a once powerful family of landowners living in a rural community in northern Japan.&nbsp; From the moment readers are introduced to the extended family, it is apparent that the war and American occupation have begun to erode the fabric that binds them all together.&nbsp; The increasing influence of political, economic and social change begins to tear into the many Tenge siblings, while a strange marriage agreement creates resentment between the eldest son and his sire.&nbsp; And when the family seems to have completely fallen apart, they decide to turn their collective rage on what they believe to be the source of their troubles&#x2014;the newest member of the Tenge family, the youngest sister Ayako.</p><p>Osamu Tezuka (1928-89) is the godfather of Japanese manga comics. He originally intended to become a doctor and earned his degree before turning to what was then a medium for children. His many early masterpieces include the series known in the U.S. as Astro Boy. With his sweeping vision, deftly interwined plots, feel for the workings of power, and indefatigable commitment to human dignity, Tezuka elevated manga to an art form. The later Tezuka, when he authored Buddha, often had in mind the mature readership that manga gained in the sixties and that had only grown ever since. The Kurosawa of Japanese pop culture, Osamu Tezuka is a twentieth century classic.A 2010<i> About.com </i>Best Manga of the Year Selection<i><br><br></i>&#x201c;Best New Seinen/Josei Manga of 2010&#x2014;Drama<br> <i>Ayako</i> depicts horrifying events, but it is beautifully presented. Connoisseurs of comics craft will find much to admire in Tezuka&#x2019;s cinematic approach to paneling, pacing, and illustration. Peter Mendelsund&#x2019;s striking design gives this 1970&#x2019;s story a modern mood to attract mature readers.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>About.com<br></i><br> &#x201c;Panel after panel flows effortlessly, composed in such a way that it draws you in, despite the cartoonish characters that Tezuka is so well known for. His scenery and backgrounds show a vibrant land slowly weighed down by filth and corruption... While I have been dismissive of Tezuka&#x2019;s work in the past, I am fully convinced by <i>Ayako</i>... This book is one of Vertical&#x2019;s finer achievements and a must-have for any Tezuka or intelligent comics fan. 9.5/10&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Comics Village</i><br><i><br></i>&#x201c;It is a portrait of humanity&#x2019;s dark side on par with Dante&#x2019;s <i>Inferno</i>... With so many interlocking storylines, all meticulously charted up to the final page, this drama plays out on a stage so grand that only Tezuka could have conceived it. Even the artwork reaches heights that are yet to be surpassed today... For pure story and visual impact, one of the best ever. A-&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Anime News Network</i><br><br> &#x201c;Like some of Vertical&#x2019;s previous long-form Tezuka releases&#x2014;<i>MW</i> and <i>Ode to Kirihito</i> in particular&#x2014;<i>Ayako</i> isn&#x2019;t afraid to get dark and dreary. In fact, <i>Ayako</i> may be one of the bleakest yet. That is, of course, said as a term of endearment; this nearly 700-page work sucks you into its twisted narrative from the very first chapter, and its grip only gets icier as the pages turn... From Peter Mendelsund&#x2019;s elegant cover design to Mari Morimoto&#x2019;s dialect-infused translation, this is another must for fans of Osamu Tezuka and comics in general.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Otaku USA</i><br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all fearless stuff, and all in the service of a story that looks pitilessly at the way people cling desperately to scraps of power and influence even as it corrupts them from within all the more. No lie is great enough to tell, no sin mortal enough to contemplate, no life sacrosanct in the face of such need. What&#x2019;s remarkable is how Tezuka&#x2019;s storytelling makes such dank and horrific things into the stuff of compulsively readable, wide-gauge visual drama. You&#x2019;re drawn in despite yourself, not just once but many times over.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Genji Press</i></p><h2>A Magickal Formulary Spellbook Companion: Book II</h2><p>Written for use by all traditions - any practioner will find it an invaluable resource.&nbsp; For the beginner and advanced student there are simple and advanced spells and rites.

Her most recent novels include <b>Until Tomorrow</b>, <b>After All</b>, <b>Last Chance</b>, and <b>Day Dreamer</b>.Returning home after seven years with the Union army, Southern born Dake Reed comes upon an overturned wagon and a dying woman who has just given birth to a baby boy. Desperate to find care for the child, Dake enlists the aid of the first woman he comes across--Cara James. Cara is hard-pressed to deny him; she wants to start a doll-making business in California and the money Dake offers her to care for the child as he searches for its relatives will help Cara achieve her dream. The pair are an unlikely match--Dake's surroundings are neat and orderly while Cara's room "looked as if she'd stirred it with a stick," but their love for the baby Clay transcends all else. After arriving at Riverglen, his war-torn Southern plantation, Dake is branded a "turn-coat" and blamed for the murder of his crippled brother. Minna, his brother's fiance, provides an alibi, but readers soon learn that Minna has all the qualities of razor blades hidden in a cream puff. When a dark secret concerning little Clay's heritage is revealed, the baby's safety becomes a fearful concern. In her latest, Landis ( Past Promises ) does what she does best by creating characters of great dimension, compassion, and strength. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The American Spirit: Who We Are and What We Stand For (Thorndike Press large print popular and narrative nonfiction)</h2><p>Collects some of the author&#39;s speeches delivered throughout the course of his career that celebrate distinctly American principles and characteristics.</p><p>David McCullough has twice received the Pulitzer Prize, for <i>Truman </i>and <i>John Adams,</i> and twice received the National Book Award, for <i>The Path Between the Seas</i> and <i>Mornings on Horseback</i>.

Antarctica, home to 100 million penguins, has ice up to three miles thick, covering 98 percent of the land. The author writes her account of this icy-cold adventure at Palmer Station in an accessible journal, sprinkled with letters home and colored-pencil sketches and photographs of various landscapes and Arctic creatures. Discussions of penguin behavior are interrupted by the history of Gondwanaland and continental drift, while snippets about trying to cook krill (the tiny phytoplankton that blue whales eat) in garlic and butter add a comic and personal touch to her adventure. Descriptions of the "green flash" that happens just before sunset, red tide, and a mirage effect called the "fata morgana" (named after the fairy Morgan who built castles in the air) are sure to intrigue and inspire young explorers. This is a charming, personable introduction to a forbidding, fascinating continent.

The author, an executive at Vienna Beef, has spent almost 40 years developing and enhancing strong emotions for the business and for the people who operate hot dog stands. The book includes detailed stories about a long list of hot dog stands located in Chicago, city and suburban, as well as stands located around the country. The one thing all those businesses have in common is that they serve or served Chicago-style hot dogs. Everyone who grew up eating hot dogs at those stands, especially in their own neighborhoods, remembers the one rule about putting condiments on a Chicago-style wiener - never put ketchup on a hot dog. This book will help the reader bring back all of those delicious memories.</p><p>Bob Schwartz has been an executive at Vienna Beef in Chicago for almost 40 years and brings to this book detailed memories about the hot dog stands, the owners and operators, and the customers who have been a part of those businesses.</p><h2>GetBackers Volume 21</h2><p>Ginji and Ban, proprieters of the retrieval agency GetBackers, have special powers enabling them to get back anything taken from their clients, and their cases lead them on many adventures.</p><p></p><h2>Contemporary Mexican Design and Architecture</h2><p>$50.00 hardcover 1-58685-088-1 November 10 x 10 in, 200 pp, 175 Color Photographs, 20 Black &amp; White Photographs, Rights: W, Architecture The architecture of Mexico is some of the most striking and vivid of any in the world, characterized by open spaces, garden living, and vibrant colors.

For Rosengarten, author of <i>The Dean &amp; Deluca Cookbook</i> among others, this means ethnic specialties like Eggplant Parmigiana and Shrimp Egg Foo Young; regional dishes, such as Philly Cheesesteak, plus barbecue, including Carolina Pulled Pork Shoulder with Two Sauces; and classic American fare like his Best Buttermilk Pancakes and The Ultimatre BLT, which transcends cultural boundaries. Offering more than 400 recipes for coast-to-coast favorites, Rosengarten is at pains to show that our cuisine is endlessly (and admirably) elastic, embracing and transforming traditional, sometimes exotic fare into something distinctly American for which we need not apologize. If he labors this point, Rosengarten has nonetheless done readers a great service in collecting so many characteristic recipes, which have often lacked the thoughtful treatment supplied here. This can mean tweaking more dubious (or degraded) recipes, lightening, for example, General Tso's chicken, or simply finding model formulas, like those for his cobb salad and macaroni and cheese (his recipes sometimes call for convenience ingredients, like banana pudding mix, that signify authentic versions). His section on regional favorites is a mini-guide to the best local dishes from New England to Hawaii, while his ethnic explorations present the food of virtually every group to have settled here--dishes that have gained acceptance, usually, through restaurant interpretations. Rosengarten has, of course, also eyed sweets, and treats such as tiramisu and New York cheesecake are also accounted for. With useful technical illustrations, ingredient notes like Spanish Paprika, and informative asides such as The Perfect Spatezel Method. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>David Rosengarten was the host of Taste on the Food Network from 1994-2000.

This period is recreated here by Graeme Fife, who uses contemporary documents, eye-witness accounts and reports to show the atmosphere of fear and suspicion that gripped the nation.</p><p>Graeme Fife is the author of numerous plays, documentaries and features for BBC Radio - including a play based on letters written by victims of the Terror. His books include Arthur the King and Tour de France - he is fluent in French, and divides his time between France and his home near Sevenoaks, Kent.Chapter One&nbsp;<br>Rebellion<br>&nbsp;<br>To prevent a Revolution, one must want a Revolution and set about making it oneself.<br>Le Comte de Rivarol<br>&nbsp;<br>Georges Jacques Danton was born in 1759 at Arcis-sur-Aube, in the lush countryside of the Champagne region. He grew up a boisterous farm boy and remained a countryman at heart: sucking milk straight from the cow's udder, he was attacked, when he was two, by an irate bull who gashed his face with a horn - it gave Danton the pug face and lip carved into what looked like a permanent sneer. He played truant from school, swam in the river, ran wild in the fields, got a good education, came to love Latin and French literature. Of the great French tragedian whose lofty drama greatly inspired Charlotte Corday, Danton said: 'Corneille was a thoroughgoing republican.'<br>&nbsp;<br>Danton, a man of bustling energy, high animal spirits and acute intelligence, typifies the kind of men who made the Revolution: a coalition of the educated and the ambitious, shunted into limited and trivial careers, their considerable gifts cheated of wider recognition by the exclusive protocols of old-regime France, the France of an absolute monarchy bolstered by intransigent belief in the divine right of kings. <br>&nbsp;<br>Voltaire had cautioned against the injudicious franchise of those not equipped mentally or socially to cope with it. 'All is lost,' he wrote, 'once the people entangles itself in reasoning', but the indignant frustrations of men like Danton were, one might almost say, generic, a crucial spur to revolution. 'The old regime,' he said, 'made a crucial error. I was educated by it as an exhibitioner at the Coll�ge du Plessis. I studied there with great nobles who . . . lived with me on equal terms. My studies over, I was left high and dry . . . my former schoolfellows turned their backs on me. The Revolution came: I and all those like me threw ourselves into it. The old regime drove us to it by giving us a good education without opening any opportunity for our talents.'<br>&nbsp;<br>He studied law and was called to the Bar at Reims, where the necessary certificates were cheap to buy. After moving to Paris he drank and played dominoes at the Caf� du Parnasse, on the right bank by the Pont Neuf, and married Gabrielle Charpentier, the wealthy proprietor's daughter. With her dowry and loans, he bought the legal practice and entr�e to the law courts of Ma�tre ['Master', the honorific title of a lawyer] Huet and was launched. <br>&nbsp;<br>He and Gabrielle lived in the Cour du Commerce, in the Latin Quarter, very near the old Franciscan convent, by then disused, in the rue des Cordeliers. In its large refectory took place the meetings and debates of one of the foremost political clubs in the city, the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Men and Citizens, attended by all the patriots of the district: the Cordeliers, after the nickname of the Franciscan friars. This district of Paris, just south of the river, part of the old medieval city, an ill-lit, poky labyrinth of narrow vennels and criss-cross streets no wider than alleys, was a known hotbed of anarchists, a nest of truculent revolutionaries, intransigently opposed to all authority. <br>&nbsp;<br>The Cordeliers were predominantly publishers, journalists, writers, booksellers and people of the theatre, among their most outspoken partisans men who played a central role in the Revolution: Fabre d'Eglantine, playwright, author of the revolutionary calendar; Jean-Nicolas Billaud-Varenne and Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois, men of the theatre, both future members of the Committee for Public Safety; Jacques-Ren� H�bert and the radical popular leader of the Commune Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette (who called himself Anaxagoras after the Greek philosopher who fell foul of the aristocratic faction in Athens in the fifth century BC); Jean-Paul Marat, 'the people's friend', author of a fescennine journal of that name; Louis Fr�ron, author, in the same vein, of another newspaper, Orator of the People; the printer-publisher Momoro, churning out political pamphlets; Elys�e Loustalot his Revolutions of Paris; and Camille Desmoulins, the progressive journalist - he and his wife Lucile were particular friends of the Dantons.<br>&nbsp;<br>The caf�s, restaurants and taverns of the Cordeliers district, centred on the club, were alive with radical thinking, heated talk, revolutionary fervour, polemical writing, the doctrines of social and political change, fermented by a potent mixed society of convinced intellectuals and impatient artisans. Desmoulins, addressing his readers as 'my dear subscribers', encouraged the notion that the area was the true heart of the Revolution, the home of the honest men who worked actively for its integrity, its universal good, its protection, without fear or favour, of the rights of all men and women, in stark contrast with the finaglers, the shifty, self-seeking, self-serving men of both the royal government and the Commune, the municipal authority of Paris. In the Cordeliers district, the republic of ideas and ideals had been brought into being. Even when the city's 60 districts were reorganised into 48 sections, the Cordeliers remained the centre of political influence on the left bank. <br>&nbsp;<br>Across the river, the Jacobin club, the Society of Friends of the Revolution, met in the former friary of the Dominican order, named Jacobins after the rue Saint Jacques, in which their parent house stood. Closer to the heart of government, they had a more prestigious membership - though Marat and Danton belonged there, too - and the rivalry between the two most powerful political clubs in Paris came, in part, to identify the war of factions within the Revolution.<br>&nbsp;<br>One of the Jacobins was a lawyer from Arras, a small town near the Belgian border. Maximilien Robespierre was born on 6 May 1758. On 16 July 1764, when he was but six years old, his mother, who had been pregnant most of his short life with his younger brother Augustin and sisters Charlotte and Henriette, died having just given birth to a fifth child who did not survive. She was 28. Was it she who taught Maximilien how to make lace? His father did not attend her funeral and a few months later left the family home for good. The two boys were taken in by their maternal grandfather and Maximilien was soon packed off to the local Oratorian school, where he was taught that Man was made to adore God and that God, the central pivot of all Creation, did not exist to oblige or serve Man. <br>&nbsp;<br>In 1769 young Robespierre enrolled at the Louis-le-Grand College in Paris, named after Louis XIV. Former students included Voltaire and the Marquis de Sade and among those there with Robespierre were Fr�ron, Desmoulins and Lebrun, who became minister of War after 10 August 1792. The daily routine had remained unchanged since the school was run by the Jesuits:<br>&nbsp;<br>Morning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afternoon, evening<br>5.30 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies and class<br>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Snack and recreation<br>6.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Study of holy scripture&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies and class<br>7.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Breakfast and recreation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supper and recreation<br>8.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Class and studies&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayer<br>10.30&nbsp;&nbsp; Mass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bed<br>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies<br>Noon&nbsp;&nbsp; Dinner and recreation<br>&nbsp;<br>This was the pattern of his life for 11 years, until he left the college aged 23. He graduated in jurisprudence in 1780 and a year later was awarded a degree at the University of Paris. These qualifications permitted him to be enrolled on the register of lawyers attached to the Parlement of Paris. He returned to Arras and practised as a barrister, on one occasion delivering an impassioned panegyric on England in defence of an Englishwoman arrested on charges of debt; on another, denouncing arbitrary imprisonment by lettre de cachet (a sealed order guaranteed by the King's private stamp) in the case of one Dupond. Under the old regime, any noble could issue this arrest warrant for the confinement or exile of anyone he deemed to be a criminal or an inconvenience: families seeking to safeguard the honour of their name in preventing misalliance, a family member disgracing them with debauchery, inebriation, debts. Abuse was rife. Strong representation against them increased during the reign of Louis XVI. A report of 1770 castigated a penal caprice which made 'none so great as to be secure from the vindictiveness of a royal minister . . . none so small as not to incur that of a farm steward'. A lettre de cachet confined Voltaire in the Bastille for a short while.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the peroration of his defence, Robespierre voiced the profound indignation which informed so much of his thinking: 'The infinite being, who has created man for sublime purposes and endowed him with faculties worthy of those purposes, has destined him for society only in that state most proper for the development of those precious faculties, whose perfection is at once the object of all his strivings and the pledge of the felicity to which his nature is susceptible.<br>&nbsp;<br>'All forms of society, all types of government, under whatever name one designates them, are good, from the moment they can lead to this important principle, and are essentially vicious and worthless whenever they go contrary to it; thus this principle is the foundation of the social contract of which we speak, so much of which is not at all the work of a free and voluntary covenant on the part of men but a contract whose fundamental conditions, written in heaven, were for all time determined by the supreme legislator, the unique source of all order, of all happiness, of all justice.'<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On the evening of 13 July 1789 a lawyer called Lavaux attended a meeting of the Cordeliers where a speaker harangued the audience from a table, telling them in a tone of high rage that the citizens must take up arms 'to repulse the 15,000 brigands mustered in Montmartre and an army of 30,000 which is preparing to pour into Paris, to loot and massacre'. His whole demeanour was fanatical and he ranted on and on until he was hoarse and spent. The man was an old friend of Lavaux - Danton, whom he had always taken to be a rather peaceable, jovial, carefree fellow, but the times were neither peaceable nor carefree.<br>&nbsp;<br>In 1787 an Assembly of Notables, hand-picked to eliminate troublemakers, had brusquely dismissed plans for much-needed fiscal reform. This can be seen as the first salvo of the Revolution. Ever more insistent demands were made for a meeting of the Estates-General, a sort of parliament called at the king's bidding which had not met since 1614. This, said the marquis de Lafayette, was the only 'true national Assembly' and only such a body, representing the whole nation, could agree to wholesale changes in taxation.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Estates-General comprised elected members of the Three Estates: the First, the clergy; the Second, the nobility; the Third, the commoners, who had always been denied partnership in the Parlements, the sovereign courts established to render justice in the last resort in the King's name. The Third Estate, which groaned under the heaviest weight of taxation yet ordinarily had no say, was demanding to be heard. Under Louis XIV, the saying went, no one dared speak. Under Louis XV, they whispered. Under Louis XVI, they talked aloud. A contemporary cartoon shows a female commoner carrying a nun and an elegantly dressed noblewoman on her back. The caption: 'Let's hope they play fair.' The Abb� Emmanuel Joseph Siey�s, one of the leading theorists of revolutionary principles, put the point succinctly in his famous pamphlet What Is the Third Estate?, January 1789: 'What is the Third Estate? Everything. What has it been until the present time? Nothing. What does it ask? To become something.'<br>&nbsp;<br>Marat reiterated much the same sentiments in his own pamphlet An Offering to the Nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Acceding to the pressure of calls for reform, the King formally summoned a meeting of the Estates-General in January 1789; elected deputies of all three Estates convened on 5 May. The debates and arguments foundered in the shoals of vagary, the indecision of the government and abject failure to agree on the way forward.<br>&nbsp;<br>On 17 June the Third Estate, exasperated with the glaring insincerity of their partners in this supposed democracy, robustly declared that they alone embodied the true national Assembly and on 20 June swore an oath on the Tennis Court at Versailles to remain in session until a constitution had been established. The King reverted to type; such defiance could not go unchecked; he gave orders summoning an army of 30,000 to Paris and by 4 July the troops were encamped in the city and the surrounding area. It was neither a remedy nor an answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>On Saturday 12 July barracking crowds invaded the theatres and forced them to close; dragoons tried to restore order; a mob occupied the Tuileries Palace. Paris was like a powder keg; one spark would set it off.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>That same day Danton's friend Desmoulins addressed an 'expectant crowd in open-necked shirts' gathered outside the Caf� Foy in the Palais Royal, the gardens of which Philippe, duc d'Orl�ans, the King's cousin, had opened to the people of Paris, further making himself popular by periodic doles of bread. These gardens, enjoying Orl�ans' extra-legal status by proxy, were a sort of free enclave within Paris, flanked with caf�s, haunted by prostitutes, rabble-rousers and intellectual agitators, seething with seditious talk.<br>&nbsp;<br>Drawing on the text of a tract he had just published, Desmoulins bade his audience: 'Listen, listen to the voices of Paris and Lyon, of Rouen and Bordeaux, of Calais and Marseille. From end to end of the nation there is one united cry: ...</p><h2>Book of Job</h2><p>This translator&#39;s vision of Job is not that of a patient sufferer, but a defiant man who demands that God explain himself and then accepts God&#39;s power with dignity and grace.

After a decade of work and groundbreaking anthologies, <i>Everything Together</i> collects his short-story comics, which condense vast amounts of emotion and information into nuanced cartoon narratives. Harkham's classic style is both articulate and expedient. At the center of the book are two vastly different tales: "Poor Sailor," a sea-faring myth of a man gone to find wealth for his love; and "Somersaulting," a kind of fever dream of teenagers in love, wiling away the summer. Alongside these stories are shorter comic strips tackling everything from Napoleon as a tortured artist to touching examinations of Jewish mysticism and life in a shtetl, to satires on contemporary university life. Throughout these tales, Harkham maintains a light touch and emotive wit. The works in this book confirm his place among the best storytellers of his generation.<br><b>Sammy Harkham</b> was born in Los Angeles in 1980, moving to Sydney, Australia, at the age of 14. He soon started making his own comics and a zine, <i>Kramers Ergot</i>, which has evolved into one of the most influential comics anthologies published today. His comic strip <i>Poor Sailor</i>, originally published in <i>Kramers Ergot</i> 4, was subsequently included in <i>Best American Nonrequired Reading of 2004 </i>and has been published in French, Korean and Italian. <i>Kramers Ergot</i> has been on numerous "best of the year" lists including the <i>LA Weekly</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Dazed and Confused</i>, <i>The Comics Journal</i> and <i>Publishers Weekly</i>. In 2006 Harkham started the ongoing comic series, <i>Crickets</i>, and edited <i>The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror</i>, and most recently the eighth volume of <i>Kramers Ergot</i>.

"'Anyone over seventy is no longer useful,' the lord declared, 'and must be taken into the mountains and left to die.'" Defying this harsh proclamation, a farmer keeps his aged mother in hiding for two years. When a nearby ruler threatens to conquer the village unless the local lord can perform three seemingly impossible tasks, only the farmer's mother succeeds in solving the puzzles. From now on, the lord declares, elders "will be treated with respect and honor, and will share with us the wisdom of their years." What's not for a parent to love here? And the clever solutions to the three tasks, plus the familiar visual cues of good-versus-evil, should gratify the younger generation, too. Ages 5-9. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Ages 5-8. Uchida retells an old Japanese folktale with quiet intensity. The cruel, young village lord decrees that people over 70 are useless and must be taken to the mountains to die. A young farmer cannot bear to abandon his mother, so he hides her deep in a cave beneath the kitchen. One day when the village is threatened by a mighty conqueror, the wisdom of the hidden old woman saves the people; then respect and honor are restored for all of the aged. The stylized airbrush-and-ink illustrations in strong shades of purple, brown, and blue have the elegance and fluidity of traditional Japanese prints. The changing perspectives express the reversals of the story as the woman, once a fugitive, gets to take center stage. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>A Vermont Christmas</h2><p>Color photographs and an evocative, anecdotal text capture the beauty, simplicity, and special quality of Vermont town and country life at Christmas</p><p></p><h2>Book Thief</h2><p>The Book Thief by Zusak, Markus.

All aspects of machine embroidery are covered, including initial inspiration and design, basic techniques, colour and composition, making this book suitable for everyone, including complete beginners.</p><p>Alison Holt studied Fine Art, Textiles and Embroidery at Goldsmiths College, London where she experimented with many textile techniques before choosing machine embroidery as a medium. She started to explore her love of gardens and the countryside through embroidery, finding it the perfect vehicle to express the various textures and forms she finds so fascinating. She now teaches machine embroidery, silk painting and surface decoration and runs courses at her studio. She also works to commission, and exhibits her embroideries in Britain and America. Her work is sold to private collectors all over the world.Here are two videos featuring Alison Holt and the techniques she uses. You will find lots more on You Tube.No. 45, Feb/Mar 07 Using the sewing machine as a tool, Alison Holt has produced an array of beautiful embroidered flowers and gardens that come alive. You can almost pick the flowers from the page, they are so beautifully constructed. The easy to follow step-by-step illustrations of silk painting and machine stitching, worked with only basic straight stitch and zigzag stitch, are so clear even those inexperienced in free-machine embroidery should be able to reproduce her beautiful designs, before moving on to produce their own designs from photographs or sketches. * Stitch * Issue 2, Winter 07 This beautifully illustrated and highly accessible book will show you how to use your sewing machine like a paintbrush to create gorgeous pictures of flowers. All aspects of machine embroidery are covered, including initial inspiration and design, basic techniques, colour and composition, making this book suitable for everyone, including complete beginners. * Flair * Issue 45 Alison&#39;s fabulous book is packed with wonderful projects to get you machine embroidering. Even if you are a complete novice, with this beautifully illustrated book to hand you&#39;ll be creating beautiful machine embroidered flowers and gardens - quicker than you could ever grow them! The detailed step-by-step illustrations make this book extremely easy to follow and you&#39;ll soon be creating your very own masterpieces. * Fabrications * Oct/Nov 06 This book is a guide to drawing flowers and foliage with a sewing machine. The vivid and colourful floral landscapes are given further depth by the use of hand-painted silk backgrounds. With clear instructions this book is suitable for all levels. * Stitch * Oct 06 Alison&#39;s stunning machine embroidered flowers look so lifelike it almost seems possible to pick them off the page. This is a brilliant book for those who enjoy free-motion embroidery as it guides the reader through the process of realistically interpreting natural subjects with stitches. It includes all the basics, and there&#39;s a particularly good section showing which stitch techniques work best for various types of flowers and foliage. The book includes many examples of Alison&#39;s exquisitely worked designs, followed by three masterclass projects where readers can follow her methods as a starting point for creating their own unique embroideries. * SEWING WORLD * Sept 06 Another of Alison Holt&#39;s popular series on machine embroidery for gardens. This one uses only two stitches, straight and zigzag, to cover a variety of effects. The backgrounds are hand-painted silk and instructions are given for all the flowers in the book, in step-by-step format. The backgrounds themselves are really lovely in loose form, even before stitching takes place. * Workshop On The Web * Nov 09 When I saw the works of Alison Holt for the first time, I thought these are beautiful landscape photographs. But as I looked more closely, I could hardly believe it that these were actually embroidered pictures. The light and shade are fantastic, the natural colours and the perspective. In her embroideries not only the colors succeed in representing forms and structures, but she also tries to catch the moment where she meets the light. She is a painter on the sewing machine for me. * Patchwork Professional * July 2006 Alison Holt uses painting with stitches to create wonderful textile pictures of plants and gardens. A keen gardener, she uses the inspiration of natural forms for the basis of her designs.The machine stitching which she uses to such good effect, develops textures and depth in her pictures which could not be obtained by painting alone. She uses silk painted backgrounds with free machined plant and flower forms in a unique and individual format. There are full colour illustrations of the techniques, with advice about composition, colour, texture and presenting finished embroideries. The examples shown are beautifully worked and would inspire beginners or experienced stitchers to look again at their gardens. * Merseyside Embroiderers Guild * Newsletter 65, Summer 2007 An excellent follow-on book to Machine Embroidered Landscapes, full of lovely illustrations of complete works with clear diagrams and instructions for the techniques to help beginners and advanced machinists alike. Forget your computerised sewing machines, this is a hands-on method with two simple stitches and a basic sewing machine.

I knew that for an absolute fact, so I was contemplating what a real damned fool I was to get mixed up in her crazy scheme when I drove the Humvee and trailer into the belly of the V-22 Osprey and tied them down.I quickly checked the stuff in the Humvee's trailer, made sure it was secure, then walked out of the Osprey and across the dark concrete ramp. Lights shining down from the peak of the hangar reflected in puddles of rainwater. The rain had stopped just at dusk, an hour or so ago.I was the only human in sight amid the tiltrotor Ospreys parked on that vast mat. They looked like medium-sized transports except that they had an engine on each wingtip, and the engines were pointed straight up. Atop each engine was a thirty-eight-foot, three-bladed rotor. The engines were mounted onswivels that allowed them to be tilted from the vertical to the horizontal, giving the Ospreys the ability to take off and land like helicopters and then fly along in winged flight like the turboprop transports they really were.I stopped by the door into the hangar and looked around again, just to make sure, then I opened the door and went inside.The corridor was lit, but empty. My footsteps made a dull noise on the tile floor. I took the second right, into a ready room.The duty officer was standing by the desk strapping a belt and holster to her waist. She was wearing a flight suit and black flying boots. Her dark hair was pulled back into a bun. She glanced at me. "Ready?""Where are all the security guards?""Watching a training film. They thought it was unusual to send everyone, but I insisted.""I sure as hell hope they don't get suspicious."She picked up her flight bag, took a last look around, and glanced at her watch. Then she grinned at me. "Let's go get 'em."<i>That</i> was Julie Giraud, and as I have said, she was crazy as hell.Me, I was just greedy. Three million dollars was a lot of kale, enough to keep me in beer and pretzels for the next hundred and ninety years. I followed this ding-a-ling bloodthirsty female along the hallway and through the puddles on the ramp to the waiting Osprey. Julie didn't run--she strode purposefully. If she was nervous or having second thoughts about committing the four dozen felonies we had planned for the next ten minutes, she sure didn't show it.The worst thing I had ever done up to that point in my years on this planet was cheat a little on my income tax--no more than average, though--andhere I was about to become a co-conspirator in enough crimes to keep a grand jury busy for a year. I felt like a condemned man on his way to the gallows, but the thought of all those smackers kept me marching along behind ol' crazy Julie.We boarded the plane through the cargo door, and I closed it behind us.Julie took three or four minutes to check our cargo, leaving nothing to chance. I watched her with grudging respect--crazy or not, she looked like a pro to me, and at my age I damn well didn't want to go tilting at windmills with an amateur.When she finished her inspection, she led the way forward to the cockpit. She got into the left seat, her hands flew over the buttons and levers, arranging everything to her satisfaction. As I strapped myself into the right seat, she cranked the left engine. The RPMs came up nicely. The right engine was next.As the radios warmed up, she quickly ran through the checklist, scanned gauges, and set up computer displays. I wasn't a pilot; everything I knew about the V-22 tiltrotor Osprey came from Julie, who wasn't given to long-winded explanations. If was almost as if every word she said cost her money.While she did her pilot thing, I sat there looking out the windows, nervous as a cat on crack, trying to spot the platoon of FBI agents who were probably closing in to arrest us right that very minute. I didn't see anyone, of course: The parking mat of the air force base was as deserted as a nudist colony in January.About that time Julie snapped on the aircraft's exterior lights, which made weird reflections on the other aircraft parked nearby, and the landing lights, powerful spotlights that shone on the concrete in front of us.She called Ground Control on the radio. Theygave her a clearance to a base in southern Germany, which she copied and read back flawlessly.We weren't going to southern Germany, I knew, even if the air traffic controllers didn't. Julie released the brakes, and almost as if by magic, the Osprey began moving, taxiing along the concrete. She turned to pick up a taxiway, moving slowly, sedately, while she set up the computer displays on the instrument panel in front of her. There were two multifunction displays in front of me too, and she leaned across to punch up the displays she wanted. I just watched. All this time we were rolling slowly along the endless taxiways lined with blue lights, across at least one runway, taxiing, taxiing ... A rabbit ran across in front of us, through the beam of the taxi light.Finally Julie stopped and spoke to the tower, which cleared us for takeoff."Are you ready?" she asked me curtly."For prison, hell or what?"She ignored that comment, which just slipped out. I was sitting there wondering how well I was going to adjust to institutional life.She taxied onto the runway, lined up the plane, then advanced the power lever with her left hand. I could hear the engines winding up, feel the power of the giant rotors tearing at the air, trying to lift this twenty-eight-ton beast from the earth's grasp.The Osprey rolled forward on the runway, slowly at first, and when it was going a little faster than a man could run, lifted majestically into the air.The crime was consummated.We had just stolen a forty-million-dollar V-22 Osprey, snatched it right out of Uncle Sugar's rather loose grasp, not to mention a half-million dollars' worth of other miscellaneous military equipment that was carefully stowed in the back of the plane.Now for the getaway.In seconds Julie began tilting the engines down to transition to forward flight. The concrete runway slid under us, faster and faster as the Osprey accelerated. She snapped up the wheels, used the stick to raise the nose of the plane. The airspeed indicator read over 140 knots as the end of the runway disappeared into the darkness below and the night swallowed us.&nbsp;<br>Two weeks before that evening, Julie Giraud drove into my filling station in Van Nuys. I didn't know her then, of course. I was sitting in the office reading the morning paper. I glanced out, saw her pull up to the pump in a new white sedan. She got out of the car and used a credit card at the pump, so I went back to the paper.I had only owned that gasoline station for about a week, but I had already figured out why the previous owner sold it so cheap: The mechanic was a doper and the guy running the register was a thief. I was contemplating various ways of solving those two problems when the woman with the white sedan finished pumping her gas and came walking toward the office.She was a bit over medium height, maybe thirty years old, a hardbody wearing a nice outfit that must have set her back a few bills. She looked vaguely familiar, but this close to Hollywood, you often see people you think you ought to know.She came straight over to where I had the little chair tilted back against the wall and asked, "Charlie Dean?""Yeah.""I'm Julie Giraud. Do you remember me?"It took me a few seconds. I put the paper down and got up from the chair."It's been a lot of years," I said."Fifteen, I think. I was just a teenager.""Colonel Giraud's eldest daughter. I remember. Do you have a sister a year or two younger?""Rachael. She's a dental tech, married with two kids.""I sorta lost track of your father, I guess. How is he?""Dead.""Well, I'm sorry."I couldn't think of anything else to say. Her dad had been my commanding officer at the antiterrorism school, but that was years ago. I went on to other assignments, and finally retired five years ago with thirty years in. I hadn't seen or thought of the Girauds in years."I remember Dad remarking several times that you were the best Marine in the corps."That comment got the attention of the guy behind the register. His name was Candy. He had a few tattoos on his arms and a half dozen rings dangling from various portions of his facial anatomy. He looked at me now with renewed interest.I tried to concentrate on Julie Giraud. She was actually a good-looking woman, with her father's square chin and good cheekbones. She wasn't wearing makeup: She didn't need any."I remember him telling us that you were a sniper in Vietnam, and the best Marine in the corps."Candy's eyebrows went up toward his hairline when he heard that."I'm flattered that you remember me, Ms. Giraud, but I'm a small-business owner now. I left the Marines five years ago." I gestured widely. "This grand establishment belongs to me and the hundreds of thousands of stockholders in BankAmerica. All of us thank you for stopping by today and giving us your business."She nodded, turned toward the door, then hesitated."I wonder if we might have lunch together, Mr. Dean."Why not? "Okay. Across the street at the Burger King, in about an hour?" That was agreeable with her. She got in her car and drove away.Amazing how people from the past pop back into your life when you least expect it.I tilted the chair back, lifted my paper and sat there wondering what in hell Julie Giraud could possibly want to talk about with me. Candy went back to his copy of <i>Rolling Stone.</i> In a few minutes two people came in and paid cash for their gas. With the paper hiding my face, I could look into a mirror I had mounted on the ceiling and watch Candy handle the money. I put the mirror up there three days ago but if he noticed, he had forgotten it by now.As the second customer left, Candy pocketed something. I didn't know if he shortchanged the customer or just helped himself to a bill from the till. The tally and the tape hadn't been jibing and Candy had a what-are-you-gonna-do-about-it-old-man attitude.He closed the till and glanced at me with a look that could only be amusement.I folded the paper, put it down, got out of the chair and went over to the counter."So you was in the Marines, huh?""Yeah."He grinned confidently. "Wouldn't have figured that."I reached, grabbed a ring dangling from his eyebrow and ripped it out.Candy screamed. Blood flowed from the eyebrow. He recoiled against the register with a look of horror on his face."The money, kid. Put it on the counter."He glanced at the blood on his hand, then pressed his hand against his eyebrow trying tostaunch the flow. "You bastard! I don't know what you--"Reaching across the counter, I got a handful of hair with my left hand and the ring in his nose with my right. "You want to lose all these, one by one?"He dug in his pocket, pulled out a wadded bill and threw it on the counter."You're fired, kid. Get off the property and never come back."He came around the counter, trying to stay away from me, one hand on his bleeding eyebrow. He stopped in the door. "I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch.""You think that through, kid. Better men than you have died trying. If you just gotta do it, though, you know where to find me."He scurried over to his twenty-five-year-old junker Pontiac. He ground and ground with the starter. Just when I thought he would have to give up, the motor belched a cloud of blue smoke.I got on the phone to a friend of mine, also a retired Marine. His name was Bill Wiley, and he worked full time as a police dispatcher. He agreed to come over that evening to help me out for a few hours at the station.It seemed to me that I might as well solve all my problems in one day, so I went into the garage to see the mechanic, a long-haired Mexican named Juan."I think you've got an expensive habit, Juan. To pay for it you've been charging customers for work you didn't do, new parts you didn't install, then splitting the money with Candy. He hit the road. You can work honest from now on or leave, your choice.""You can't prove shit."He was that kind of guy, stupid as dirt. "I don't have to prove anything," I told him. "You're fired."He didn't argue; he just went. I finished fixing the flat he had been working on, waited on customers until noon, then locked the place up and walked across the street to the Burger King.&nbsp;<br>Of course I was curious. It seemed doubtful that Julie Giraud wanted to spend an hour of her life reminiscing about the good old days at Quantico with a retired enlisted man who once served under her father, certainly not one twenty-five years older than she was.So what did she want?"You are not an easy man to find, Mr. Dean."I shrugged. I'm not trying to lose myself in the madding crowd, but I'm not advertising either."My parents died twelve years ago," she said, her eyes on my face."Both of them?" I hadn't heard. "Sorry to hear that," I said."They were on an Air France flight to Paris that blew up over Niger. A bomb.""Twelve years ago.""Dad had been retired for just a year. He and Mom were traveling, seeing the world, falling in love with each other all over again. They were on their way to Paris from South America when the plane blew up, killing everyone aboard."I lost my appetite for hamburger. I put it down and sipped some coffee.She continued, telling me her life story. She spent a few more years in high school, went to the Air Force Academy, was stationed in Europe flying V-22 Ospreys, was back in the States just now on leave.When she wound down, I asked, as gently as I could, why she looked me up.She opened her purse, took out a newspaper clipping, offered it to me. "Last year a French court tried the men who killed my parents. They are Libyans.Moammar Gadhafi refused to extradite them from Libya, so the French tried them in absentia, convicted them, sentenced them to life in prison."I remembered reading about the trial. The clipping merely refreshed my memory. One hundred forty people died when that Air France flight exploded; the debris was scattered over fifty square miles of desert."Six men, and they are still in Libya." Julie gestured at the newspaper clipping, which was lying beside my food tray. "One of the men is Gadhafi's brother-in-law, another is a key figure in Libyan intelligence, two are in the Libyan diplomatic service." She gripped the little table between us and leaned forward. "They blew up that airliner on Gadhafi's order to express the dictator's displeasure with French foreign policy at the time. It was raw political terrorism, Mr. Dean, by a nation without the guts or wit to wage war. They just murder civilians."I folded the clipping, then handed it back."Ms. Giraud, I'm sorry that your parents are dead. I'm sorry about all those people who died on that airline...</p><h2>Homespun Style</h2><p>If flat-pack furniture and expensive designer pieces aren&#x2019;t really your thing, and you&#x2019;d rather make your own cushion cover than buy it, then Homespun Style is for you.<br><br>Showcasing inspiring homes around the world, the book reflects our growing passion for crafting, stitching, and painting.

The church was dark and simple. White candles in glass sconces lined the gray stone walls, and a gigantic candelabra cast a golden glow on the altar. The pews were trimmed with sprigs of bittersweet and branches of Chinese lantern plant tied with brown and orange gauzy ribbons. </p> <p>The wedding was perfect, except for two things. The satin bridesmaids&#x2019; gowns that were ordered in deep, rich cinnamon showed up two days before the wedding and were bright Halloween pumpkin. And instead of standing across from the groom, beaming, I was standing across from his first cousin, Norman, smiling a hollow smile like a jack-o&#x2019;- lantern. </p> <p>That, and I probably wouldn&#x2019;t have gone with brown roses. I tried to talk Janie out of them. </p> <p>&#x201c;Brown is the color of dead flowers, Janie.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;But they don&#x2019;t look like dead flowers, Van. They&#x2019;re elegant.&#x201d; </p> <p>It was a lost cause. Martha Stewart Weddings had a spread of fall bouquets, and Janie&#x2019;s mom made a ton of trips out to Connecticut to exactly the same florist to have exactly the same bouquets made for Janie&#x2019;s wedding. </p> <p>Out of the corner of my eye I saw Janie&#x2019;s cousin Libby standing next to me, dabbing at her eyes with a lace-trimmed handkerchief. Not only did she have the teary smile down, but she somehow managed to look fabulous in bright orange. I couldn&#x2019;t see Bethany, Janie&#x2019;s college friend, from where I was standing, but I was sure she was crying appropriately as well. She seemed like the type. At least she looked awful in her dress too. </p> <p>I spent the whole ceremony with my hands wrapped around my bouquet of bittersweet and Janie&#x2019;s brown roses, digging my nails through my orange satin gloves into the back of my other hand. </p> <p>I missed the part about anyone having any reasons as to why these two blah blah blah blah blah . . . I missed the &#x201c;I do&#x2019;s&#x201d; and all that crap. I just stood there and concentrated on pressing hard enough to feel pain through two layers of thick satin. </p> <p>I tried not to look at Peter, in his slate gray tuxedo and shiny shoes, as perfect as the porcelain groom Janie ordered for the top of their wedding cake. And I tried not to look at Janie, glowing in the reflection of candlelight sparkling off of the crystals hand-sewn along the neckline of her dress. I stared at the brown roses and tried to make it look like I was solemnly meditating on the meaning of marriage and the serious commitment being made before my very eyes. </p> <p>Then they were kissing and the whole deal was done. Janie pressed her hand against Peter&#x2019;s chest to keep him from kissing her too long or too hard or in a way that might be inappropriate for the photographer to capture. I would have held him as close as I could for as long as I could, but I tried not to let myself think about it. I put the jack-o&#x2019;- lantern smile back on my face and handed Janie her brown flowers. </p> <p>Norman and I followed them down the aisle, my hand positioned just above the crook of his elbow the way Vanessa, the wedding planner, showed me. We walked in &#x201c;step-pause&#x201d; time. Norman reached across with his other arm and put his hand over mine. I kicked him in his calf during the pause part of our procession walk, and hissed, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get ideas, Normy,&#x201d; through my smile. He dropped his hand back to his side. </p> <p>At the reception at the Kittle House, Norman rambled through a long and painful toast that started with how he and Peter used to think girls had cooties and ended with a diatribe about his divorce and how he couldn&#x2019;t have gotten through it without Peter. We raised our glasses of champagne before switching over to spiced wine for the traditional Thanksgiving feast, spread out across the tables like a picture of gluttony from the time of kings and knights. </p> <p>I was thankful that Janie&#x2019;s father decided it was tacky for the maid of honor to toast the couple. This was a rule he probably made once he realized I was going to be Janie&#x2019;s maid of honor, no matter what he had to say about it. Charles Driscoll hated me ever since I taught Janie the f-bomb in fourth grade. Janie got sent home from school for saying it in front of her teacher, leaving a permanent mark on her pristine school record. </p> <p>Charles will always blame me for Janie not getting into Harvard and having to go to Brown instead. He will forever be convinced that the f-bomb blemish on Janie&#x2019;s permanent grade school record had kept her out. In reality, she stuffed her application in my book bag instead of the mailbox. Every time I see him now, I want to scream, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not because I taught your daughter to say fuck, it&#x2019;s because she didn&#x2019;t want to go to Harvard, you dumb ass!&#x201d; but in honor of the wedding, I resigned myself to, &#x201c;Mr. Driscoll, you must be so proud.&#x201d; </p> <p>After the first course, Peter stood up to say a few words about his lovely bride and the joyous occasion. He described Janie as angelic. He kept calling her Jane. He used the word joyous more than once, and quite frankly, it was overkill. </p> <p>Just when I thought he was finally done, he said, &#x201c;I also want to thank Savannah Leone for being such a wonderful friend to me and my wife.&#x201d; He laughed softly and looked into his champagne flute. &#x201c;Wow, my wife. It&#x2019;s so strange and amazing to say that word.&#x201d; He reached over and kissed Janie on the cheek. The wedding photographer had a field day. &#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; Peter continued, &#x201c;as I was saying, Van is the real deal. She&#x2019;s a true friend, and I would have stolen her for my best man, if Jane had let me&#x2014;no offense, Normy&#x2014;but I think Van would look far more stunning in that tux, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; He laughed again and waited for the crowd to laugh too. &#x201c;The truth is, if it weren&#x2019;t for Van, Jane and I never would have met. So if we&#x2019;re going to raise our glasses to toast to this union, let&#x2019;s also raise our glasses to Van for starting it all.&#x201d; </p> <p> The room filled with clinks and the murmur of three hundred of their closest friends saying, &#x201c;Cheers.&#x201d; Janie clinked her glass against Peter&#x2019;s and then turned to tap mine, but hugged me instead. &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; she whispered into my ear. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;d do without you.&#x201d; Her ribs pulsed against mine and her breath quickened. </p> <p>&#x201c;I love you too, but nobody likes a weepy bride,&#x201d; I said, pulling away, trying my best to smile. &#x201c;Pull yourself together, lady!&#x201d; I picked up my napkin. &#x201c;Look up.&#x201d; Janie looked to the ceiling and I used a corner of the white linen to soak up a tear that was balanced on her lashes before it could make a mess of her makeup. &#x201c;We can be sappy another day.&#x201d; </p> <p>I wished I could vanish, just melt into the floor, leaving behind nothing but a puddle of orange satin and shoes dyed to match. </p> <p>When Janie and Pete got up to get ready for their first dance, I started seriously contemplating hiding in the coat closet with a bottle of champagne and an armload of Jordan almonds wrapped up in that stupid white netting. I was supposed to be happy for them. I was supposed to be cheering them on. That&#x2019;s what it means to be a maid of honor&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about being eternally excited and supportive for every single little second of the wedding, and I couldn&#x2019;t even bear to watch them dance. </p> <p>&#x201c;Well, Vannie, I haven&#x2019;t seen you in ages.&#x201d; Peter&#x2019;s aunt Agnes sat down next to me. She never had her own children, and as far as she was concerned, the sun rose and set around Peter. Peter worshiped her, but I called her Aunt Agony. She took us out to dinner a few times up at school, but a good meal was never worth listening to her talk. &#x201c;We have to catch up. Tell me everything about everything, dear.&#x201d; </p> <p>&#x201c;First dance.&#x201d; I pointed to the dance floor as Peter and Janie walked toward each other and met in the middle. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better go. Maid of honor.&#x201d; I gave her a big closed-mouth smile and got up to stand at the edge of the dance floor. I wasn&#x2019;t sure which form of torture was worse. </p> <p>While I stood with the crowd, watching the happy couple dance to &#x201c;The Way You Look Tonight,&#x201d; Diane Driscoll came over and put her arm around my waist. She leaned against me and rested her head on my shoulder. </p> <p> &#x201c;We did a good job with our little girl, don&#x2019;t you think, Vannie?&#x201d; she said. </p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t know if she meant tonight, or in general. And I couldn&#x2019;t tell if I was included in the &#x201c;we&#x201d; or if she just meant her and Charles. </p> <p>But then she said, &#x201c;I wish Natalie could see this,&#x201d; and I knew the &#x201c;we&#x201d; meant her and my mom. &#x201c;You know, you look just like she did the first time I met her,&#x201d; she said, and lifted her head to kiss my cheek. She put her head back on my shoulder, and I felt her tears run down my arm while we watched Janie and Peter finish their dance with the complicated turn Vanessa taught them. </p> <p>She wiped at her eyes quickly and turned toward me, grabbing both my arms. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re coming back to stay at the house tonight, right?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I set up the carriage house with junk food and movies. I thought we could celebrate like old times.&#x201d; </p> <p>My mom and I used to live in the Driscolls&#x2019; carriage house, which was two hundred and eighty-two steps from the front door of the main house ( Janie and I counted the summer before we started fourth grade) on their spra...</p></p><h2>The Perfect Poison (Arcane Society, Book 6)</h2><p>Consulting on the investigation into a lord&#39;s murder, botanist Lucinda Bromley realizes that a poison can be traced back to her, prompting her to hire fellow Arcane Society member Caleb Jones to keep her name out of the investigation and to find the murderer, in a historical, romantic mystery, that has a dark conspiracy at its heart.</p><p>Quick is a pseudonym for Jayne Ann Krentz, the author-under various pen names-of more than forty <strong>New York Times</strong> bestsellers.

Includes recipes.</p><p>Mary Gunderson is a Capstone Press author.Grade 3-6-If readers like their history served up on a plate, then this series is for them. Historical narrative is blended with recipes of the time, thus giving glimpses of the period while introducing traditional foods of hungry cowboys, frontier families, and intrepid explorers of the 1800s. An editor's note explains that, "Although based on historical foods, recipes have been modernized and simplified for today's young cooks." Lewis and Clark draws clear connections from history to food by utilizing passages from Lewis's account of the journey. Foods and preparations follow the expedition's travels through various regions and include meals that are indigenous to the countryside. The favorite will probably be Cowboy Cooking. Heavily illustrated with photographs and complete with recipes for standard fare including biscuits, beans, and beef, this book gives readers a real sense of life on the dusty trail. There's even a section on etiquette and the cowboy "sweet tooth." Oregon Trail, the weakest of the three, intersperses recipes and historical information less smoothly. Perhaps it's the quirks of layout, but the placement of a lemonade recipe opposing the page giving an overview of the ill-fated Donner Party seems incongruous. Still, all three titles are visual delights that include many photographs and period illustrations.<br><i>Leslie Millrod, Westhampton Free Library, NY </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Protest: Culture and Activism from the Civil Rights Movement to the Streets of Seattle</h2><p>Imagine the civil rights movement without freedom songs and the politics of women&#39;s movements without poetry. Or, more difficult yet, imagine an America unaffected by the cultural expressions and forms of the twentieth-century social movements that have shaped our nation. The first broad overview of social movements and the distinctive cultural forms that express and helped shape them, The Art of Protest shows the vital importance of these movements to American culture. In comparative accounts of movements beginning with the African American civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s and running through the Internet-driven movement for global justice (&#34;Will the revolution be cybercast?&#34;) of the twenty-first century, T. V. Reed enriches our understanding of protest and its cultural expression. Reed explores the street drama of the Black Panthers, the revolutionary murals of the Chicano movement, the American Indian Movement&#39;s use of film and video, rock music and the struggles against famine and apartheid, ACT UP&#39;s use of visual art in the campaign against AIDS, and the literature of environmental justice. Throughout, Reed employs the concept of culture in three interrelated ways: by examining social movements as sub- or countercultures; by looking at poetry, painting, music, murals, film, and fiction in and around social movements; and by considering the ways in which the cultural texts generated by resistance movements have reshaped the contours of the wider American culture. The United States is a nation that began with a protest. Through the kaleidoscopic lens of artistic and cultural expression, Reed reveals how activism continues to remake our world.</p><p>T. V. Reed is director of American studies and professor of English at Washington State University. He is the author of Fifteen Jugglers, Five Believers: Literary Politics and the Poetics of American Social Movements."Sophisticated yet very accessible, with a fluid writing style and well-organized chapters ranging from black civil rights to global justice.

But, the strangest trip he ever took was the journey he made as a man of science into the realm of the spiritual. In a remote Siberian village, Turk met an elderly Koryak shaman named Moolynaut who invoked the help of a Spirit Raven to mend his fractured pelvis. When the healing was complete, he was able to walk without pain. Turk, finding no rational explanation, sought understanding by traversing the frozen tundra where Moolynaut was born, camping with bands of reindeer herders, and recording stories of their lives and spirituality. Framed by high adventure across the vast and forbidding Siberian landscape, <i>The Raven&#x2019;s Gift </i>creates a vision of natural and spiritual realms interwoven by one man&#x2019;s awakening. <p></p></p><p>JON TURK is the author of twenty-five environmental and earth science text books and two previous adventure travel books. He is a world-class adventurer whose expeditions are backed by Necky Kayaks, for whom he serves as a national spokesman.

In an effort to probe into the nature of the chemical bond, that much studied but still mysterious collection of forces that holds all matter together, I blasted molecules apart with a beam of high-energy electrons and then accelerated the resultant fragments into a powerful magnetic field.It was intense, stressful work, and one sunny weekend day, in the spring of 1970, I went for a walk with my dog across an alpine meadow in the Colorado Rockies. A few patches of crusty snow lingered in shady and north-facing aspects, but the open spaces were dominated by young, green grasses, the lifesaving nutrition for elk and deer after a long, hungry winter. The earth was moist and spongy underfoot and I knelt down to smell a glacier lily that had opened its petals to the warm, spring sun. My dog suddenly raced off at sprint speed for about fifty yards, leapt into the air like a fox, with his front paws spinning, and landed, digging furiously, clods of sod flying into the air. I felt certain that he was chasing a ground squirrel, futilely trying to dig faster than the rodent could run through its tunnel, the waydogs chase prey, as sport, because they know that a bowl of kibble awaits them back home and failure holds no penalties.I sauntered over, but by the time I arrived, my dog had abandoned that hole, sprinted another fifty yards, and repeated this same odd behavior. There was no evidence of any burrow in the vicinity of the first hole, nor at his second, or his third, or fourth. Had he gone mad? I watched him more closely. Each time, after breaking through the protective sod, he shoved his nose into the earth and sniffed, then dug, and sniffed again. What did he smell down there? I squatted on my hands and knees and tentatively stuck my nose into one of his holes. Even my human senses could detect the sweet aroma of decay as mites and bacteria woke from their winter somnolence and began to munch and crunch, as only mites and bacteria know how, to convert bits of roots and old leaves into soil.I assumed that my dog, with his animal instinct, was rejoicing in the process of spring, in the primordial smell of rebirth and renewed growth, a smell that originated when organisms first ventured onto the naked rock of the continents. By the time I reached the fifth hole, my nose and cheeks were smudged with dirt and bits of moist soil lodged onto the hairs of my nostrils, so the earth was inside me, as if we had just made a lifelong pact of togetherness. I lay on the grass, sandwiched between the chill spring dampness on my stomach and the warm sun beating against my back.The next morning, I returned to the lab, as usual, but something inside me had changed. Although the dog caper, by itself, didn't create an instant epiphany; it was the tipping point. Over the next few weeks, I realized that I couldn't spend my whole life down there in that room, which suddenly felt like a dungeon, manipulating particles that I could never see, under the flicker of fluorescent lights, in a world permeated forever with the smell of acetone and benzene. A year later, I finished my thesis, stuffed my Ph.D. diploma in the glove box of a battered Ford Fairlane, lashed a canoe on top, and headed into the Arctic.Since that time, my entire adult life has been a balancing act between science on one hand and the smell of the earth that became so seminal that spring day in the Rockies on the other. I have made the bulk of my livingwriting college-level textbooks on geology, environmental science, chemistry, physics, and astronomy. At the same time, I moved to a ski town and became involved in high-intensity rock climbing, skiing, kayaking, and later mountain biking. Climbing a vertical granite wall in a remote region of the Canadian Arctic--vulnerable to gales from the North Pole--involves a different level of intensity than smelling the spring earth. But the relationship between the two is stronger than most people would suspect. During expeditions, the often razor-thin margin between life and death depends on a tactile, sensory awareness of the environment that incorporates but also transcends logic. My first introduction to that awareness occurred on a spring day when I was walking in a meadow with my dog.Over the decades, these two aspects of my dichotomous personality have forged a comfortable symbiosis. I have grown to enjoy the exhilaration and toil of arduous expeditions to remote, dangerous, and beautiful places, and at the same time I am always happy to return home, sit in a comfortable office chair, and distill complex scientific concepts into sentences that a college student can understand and appreciate.But if I thought I understood my relationship with these two disparate worlds, nothing had prepared me for the day when I stood naked on one leg before Moolynaut, a one-hundred-year old Siberian shaman and healer, with my right hand behind my back and my left arm pointed straight in front of me. When I stabilized my balance, she chanted herself into a trance and asked Kutcha, the Raven God, to heal my overused and battered body.THE RAVEN'S GIFT. Copyright � 2009 by Jon Turk.

Robert Jordan is a pseudonym as well, however. The author's real name is James Oliver Rigney Jr., and, in 1981, before he ever wrote as Robert Jordan, he penned this vigorous, bodice-ripping historical as the second novel of a trilogy (begun with The Fallon Blood, 1980, reprinted in hardcover in 1995). The narrative here bursts with information about the sea ("Occasionally a lateen-rigged polacca or xebec slowly circled the brig, swarthy crew staring unblinkingly") and the state of political affairs at the dawn of the 19th century. Madison, Burr, Monroe, Jefferson and even Davy Crockett are all thrown into this complex tale of Captain Robert Fallon?merchant, patriot and lover par excellence. Fallon is the sworn enemy of two evil and powerful men, Justin Fourrier and a pirate named Murad Reis, who try, with little luck, to hunt Fallon down as he sails around the world. A dose of incest is also tossed into the convoluted plot as Fallon and his half-sister, Catherine, fall into each other's arms. This is old-fashioned entertainment?that is, typical of the genre in the early 1980s?in which good and evil are as clear as the water is blue and subtlety is an unknown entity. Jordan dashes it off with energy, and it's easy to discern here the seeds of the popular fantasy novels to come. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ironclad Alibi (Harrison Raines Civil War Mysteries, Book 3)</h2><p>Union secret agent Harrison Raines is sent into the heart of the Confederacy to obtain information about "The Monster"-the hulking remains of the ironclad ship Merrimack, which is being restored. But before he can complete his mission, he must solve the murder of his first love, and clear his best friend of the crime. <br><br> Praise for the series: <br><br> "Both Civil War and mystery fans will appreciate Kilian's grasp of the genres of historical fiction and mystery." (<i>Booklist</i>) <br><br> "Kilian blends fiction and history, using real people to establish a believable context and create an absorbing period piece." (<i>San Antonio Express-News</i>) <br><br> "Kilian offers clues for anyone wishing to guess the identity of the murderer, but also indulges in a case of misdirection that might nag at a genuine mystery buff for months. Picaresque adventure." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) <br><br> "An engaging character." (<i>The Denver Post</i>)</p><p><p>Michael Kilianis a Washington, DC correspondent for the <b>Chicago Tribune</b> and the author of numerous books, including the Harrison Raines Civil War Mysteries. His family includes early settlers of Virginia and New York, and Union soldiers who died at Fredericksburg and fought at Gettysburg on Little Round Top.</p>Who done it? The Monitor or the Merrimac (aka Virginia)? Kilian's third Civil War noir (after 2001's A Killing at Ball's Bluff) is a combination espionage and private-eye mystery, which succeeds delightfully on both counts with its vivid historical background, well-realized characters and engrossing plot. The author's portrait of wartime Richmond is especially good. Series hero Harrison Raines, a son of the Old South with radical ideas such as abolition, has fled to the North to fight for the Union. Now he returns to Richmond to learn what he can about "the Monster" that has all Washington in jitters. An ironclad ship! Said to be invincible. With it, the South could smash the Union blockade, possibly even sail up the Potomac and attack Washington itself. While snooping, Harry meets a lady friend of whom he was once very fond. When she's later found naked, hanged in his room, Harry's friend Caesar Augustus, formerly his slave and now his associate in the spy business, is arrested for the murder. Only through the intervention of Robert E. Lee is Harry given one week to discover the real murderer. For a time, it seems as if Harry (and the author) have forgotten all about the Monster; but, no, the trail of the killer leads Harry right into the very heart of the beast as it sets out to destroy the Union fleet. A colorful and exciting climax caps a book that entertains from start to finish. Highly recommended for mystery and Civil War buffs alike. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Lilies of the Field.

Unfortunately, it looks like every bird in town is spoken for -- until Arthur happens to find a mad inventor who offers to sell Arthur one of his "superchickens" at a bargain price of six cents per pound (and NO REFUNDS). </p><p> When Arthur returns home with Henrietta, his mother refuses to cook a sixfoot, 266-pound chicken, which is fine because Arthur has started to grow fond of her. But then Henrietta accidentally wanders off alone, and dreadful rumors of a dangerous monster running amok through the city spread like wildfire, causing panicky townspeople to cower in their homes. With Henrietta on the loose, the city of Hoboken will never be the same. </p><p> Since 1977, Daniel Pinkwater's hilarious tale of a boy and his chicken has tickled the funny bones of thousands of readers. Now paired with Jill Pinkwater's droll illustrations, the stage is set for the next generation of fans.</p></p><p><b>Daniel</b> and <b>Jill Pinkwater</b> have also collaborated on such picture books as <i>Rainy Morning</i> and <i>Wallpaper from Space.</i> Daniel has penned many other popular stories; he also reviews children's books for NPR and developed the new <i>Chinwag Theater.</i> The Pinkwaters live in Hyde Park, New York.When young Arthur Bobowicz brings home a 266-pound live chicken instead of a turkey for Thanksgiving, listeners know they're in for a hilarious tale. Arthur names his new pet Henrietta and teaches her tricks using oatmeal cookies. When Henrietta runs away, Hoboken will never be the same. Pinkwater's radio background serves him well in his delivery of a contemporary children's story. His narration convinces listeners that it's perfectly reasonable to have a 266-pound pet chicken. Pinkwater throws out jokes without missing a beat or losing the listener. The only disappointing thing about this audiobook is that it ends too soon.

ROSEN</b> is the award-winning author of more than two dozen picture books. He lives in central Ohio.<br><br><b>MELISSA IWAI</b> has illustrated two other picture books. She lives in Brooklyn, New York. <br>Ages 4-7. Chanukah, the Festival of Lights, as seen through the eyes of a young boy, is the focus of this simple yet effective story. Each two-page spread highlights one candle on the menorah as the boy finds other lights--in his home, his neighborhood, his world--that mirror the festive illuminations: "On the fourth night of Chanukah, I find four lights in the kitchen: Mom fries up platters of latkes, and four flames flicker under the sizzling skillets." Iwai's art has a solid feel that mirrors the sturdy story, while the unusual perspectives add a whimsical veneer. Children who don't know much about the holiday may be a little lost; an endnote makes clear some things, but not all. What kids will respond to is the warm feeling this generates and the sheer sense of wonder that the narrator so innocently exudes. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Alone in his room he transforms his face with makeup and tape, and then takes pictures with a Polaroid. In a town of nonbelievers, Alonzo is an expert on monsters, vampires, and assorted ghouls. One year, as Halloween approaches (as does Alonzo's 10th birthday), rumors of a mysterious beast start circulating, and suddenly Alonzo's grisly expertise is in great demand. But who--or what--is this horrible beast that crushes gladiolas in the night and leaves claw prints on cars? And will Alonzo's wish for fame and understanding from his friends and neighbors ever come true?<p> Brian Selznick's black-and-white pencil drawings set a spooky stage for this story of intrigue and imagination. Although the plot is convoluted and faintly perplexing, the overall effect is pleasingly sinister. Close-ups of Mr. Blake, Alonzo's seemingly mild-mannered neighbor and cohort in all things macabre, inspire speculation about skeletons he may be harboring in his own closet.

In discussing the limitations of words and language, he emphasizes our need to go beyond words in our quest for universal truths.

He has written many novels and has won the GUARDIAN Fiction Award for CONDITION OF MUSAK and was short-listed for the Whitbread Prize for MOTHER LONDON. In recent years he has achieved an international reputation and is now recognised as a major contemporary novelist. A longtime resident of London, he now lives near Austin, Texas, with his wife.Vast, sprawling, eccentric, this masterful comic novel seems to encapsulate the history of postwar Britain in its dizzy decline. Its three main characterspatients (and later outpatients) at a psychiatric clinicare improbable yet believable. We meet dreamy Mary Gasalee, a recovered amnesiac widowed and psychically scarred in the London Blitz, and the two men she seduces: young David Mummery, writer of books on London's sewers, subways and ruins, who clings to his idealized memory of their romance; and Josef Kiss, one-time professional mind-reader and grandiloquent, roving Falstaffian actor. All three are "wireless receivers," gifted with psychic or intuitive faculties they would rather not have. Hopping from 1940 to the present across London's patchwork of neighborhoods, Moorcock augments the touching, tawdry tales of these intertwined lives with an enormous cast of secondary characters. Down-and-out artists, petty thieves, anxious immigrants, trendy nouveaux-riches, government functionaries, mavericks and misfits populate this elegiac valentine, as varied and alive as London itself. It's a story about the myths people create in order to survive, and Moorcock brings to it the same inventiveness found in his science fantasy ( Dancers at the End of Time ) and historical allegory ( The Brothel in Rosenstrasse ). <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Subtle Citation, Allusion, and Translation in the Hebrew Bible</h2><p>Biblicists have long been aware that some compositions in the Bible cite and allude to other compositions.

Metal is not only a pastime for the true aficionados; it&#x2019;s a lifestyle and obsession that permeates every aspect of their being. <em>Louder Than Hell</em> is an examination of that cultural phenomenon and the much-maligned genre of music that has stood the test of time.</p><p><em>Louder than Hell</em> features more than 250 interviews with some of the biggest bands in metal, including Black Sabbath, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Spinal Tap, Pantera, White Zombie, Slipknot, and Twisted Sister; insights from industry insiders, family members, friends, scenesters, groupies, and journalists; and 48 pages of full-color photographs.</p></p><p><p>From Sabbath to Slipknot, <em>Louder Than Hell</em> is the definitive oral history of heavy metal, straight from the mouths of those who defined it.

They have unearthed never-before-heard stories, eye-opening admissions, and the truth behind some of metal&#x2019;s wildest moments, such as the industrial accident that forever changed the sound of Black Sabbath, the experiences that got Dave Mustaine booted from Metallica, and the bloodletting rituals of death metal bands Morbid Angel and Deicide. <em>Louder Than Hell</em> is packed with raw and unflinching commentary from icons of metal from its inception in the late 1960s to the current day, including Ozzy Osbourne, Bruce Dickinson, Eddie Van Halen, Tommy Lee, Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield, Kerry King, Vince Neil, Axl Rose, Jonathan Davis, Corey Taylor, Pete Steele, Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Dimebag Darrell, and hundreds of others.</p><p>From groundbreaking innovations such as the dawn of distortion and the birth of cookie monster vocals to amazing tales of destruction and wild sexual escapades, <em>Louder Than Hell</em> has it all, like the evolution of Judas Priest&#x2019;s seminal powerchord sound and patented leather-and-studs look; the provocative exploits of the Sunset Strip scene; and the truth behind the Norwegian church burnings and murders that became synonymous with black metal. Discover how Faith No More accidentally created rap-metal and who invented the &#x201c;devil horns&#x201d;&#x2014;and how most people do it wrong.</p><p><em>Louder Than Hell</em> is the definitive look behind the curtain at one of our most dynamic and enduring musical genres.

Included are Hixon's consultations of the I Ching and an explication of Turiya as taught by Advaita Vedanta and experienced by Hixon with Swami Nikhilananda as his teacher.

Z. S. Strother contends that the dialectic of humor and violence reveals deep insights into the psychology of power and resistance that continues to operate in the region today. Her argument is built on a set of works of art and demonstrates the important role that patronage and political and social history played in their creation. Strother conveys Central African ideas about how the therapeutic power of humor can initiate social change and upset power relations between oppressors and oppressed. This analysis plunges seemingly benign figures into a maelstrom of violence and crime&#x2013;rape, murder, torture, and forced labor on a massive scale. By restoring the dialectic of humor, it reveals the complicated psychological codependency of Africans and Europeans over a long period of history and maintains that art plays a mediating function in the mechanics and ethics of power.</p></p><p><p>Z. S. Strother is Riggio Professor of African Art at Columbia University. She is author of <i>Inventing Masks: Agency and History in the Art of the Central Pende</i>, winner of the Arnold Rubin Outstanding Publication Award. http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Strother.html</p><p>"Perceptive, nuanced, and sensitive to change over time and place, Zoe Strother's Humor and Violence is laugh-out-loud funny. In this dazzling array of art, Europeans constitute a cultural category&#x2015;people who perform an identity of yappy little dogs and drunkenness&#x2015;but, most fundamentally, of violence. Here are rape, murder, torture, and forced labor; here is the humor of tragic parody, defiance, and healing. Strother's superb close reading of the art together with her careful dating for historical context and unblinking truth-telling make this an extraordinarily valuable work, an essential contribution to cultural history as well as art history."</p> (Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People)<br><br><p>"Original and provocative, it offers a revealing and compelling analysis and interpretation of representations of humor and violence&#x2015;two cultural forms of expression that are almost impossible to put into words. A rich and rewarding work that will sustain thoughtful reflection."</p> (Henry John Drewal <i>editor of Sacred Waters</i>)<br><br><p>"Z. S. Strother does not shy away from difficult and controversial topics, whether European or Congolese.

A former reporter for the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine, she is a professor of literature at Claremont-McKenna College in California.<br><br>Kincaid ( At the Bottom of the River ; Annie John ) has with this novel created an insouciant yet vulnerable narrator in the person of Lucy, a teenage girl from the West Indies who works as an au pair for a seemingly happy family in an unidentified city that one assumes is New York. Lucy is fascinated with her discoveries about American life--"At first it was all so new that I had to smile with my mouth turned down at the corners"--and with Mariah, Lewis and their four golden little daughters. Their pleasure in life intrigues Lucy, who observes, "Even when a little rain fell, they would admire the way it streaked through the blank air." Lucy has renounced her own family and past, but at the same time she paradoxically expresses culturally imbued views with arrogance. She sees the world around her with both awe and contempt, and maintains a unique dead certainty about how people are. Her own sexual exploits seem more mysterious to her than the deterioration of Lewis and Mariah's marriage, which she presciently and detachedly observes. This is a slim book but Kincaid has crafted it with a spare elegance that has brilliance in its very simplicity. Lucy's is a haunting voice, and Kincaid's originality has never been more evident.

Shlaim presents compelling evidence for a revaluation of traditional Israeli history."&#x2015;<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong></p> As it celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, the State of Israel could count many important successes, but its conflict with the Palestinians and the Arab world at large casts a long shadow over its history. What was promulgated as an "iron-wall" strategy&#x2015;dealing with the Arabs from a position of unassailable strength&#x2015;was meant to yield to a further stage where Israel would be strong enough to negotiate a satisfactory peace with its neighbors. The goal remains elusive. In this penetrating study, Avi Shlaim examines how variations of the iron-wall philosophy have guided Israel&#x2019;s leaders; he finds that, while the strategy has been successful, opportunities have been lost to progress from military security to broader peace. The <em>Iron Wall</em> brilliantly illuminates past progress and future prospects for peace in the Middle East. Illustrations, maps and photographs</p><p>In 1897, under order of First Zionist Congress president Theodor Herzl, two Austrian rabbis traveled to Palestine to explore the possibility of locating a Jewish state there. "The bride is beautiful," the rabbis cabled Herzl, "but she is married to another man." That "other man" was the Palestinian Arab nation, long established in the region as a political entity. Undeterred, Herzl pressed on with his program of emigration, ignoring Palestine's existing occupants and creating in the process what came to be known as the "Arab question."<p> In this far-ranging history, Avi Shlaim analyzes that question in remarkable detail, tracing the shifting policies of Israel toward the Palestinians and the Arab world at large. Herzl, he writes, followed a policy that consciously sought to enlist the great powers--principally Britain and later the United States--while dismissing indigenous claims to sovereignty; after all, Herzl argued, "the Arab problem paled in significance compared with the Jewish problem because the Arabs had vast spaces outside Palestine, whereas for the Jews, who were being persecuted in Europe, Palestine constituted the only possible haven." This policy later changed to a stance of confrontation against the admittedly hostile surrounding Arab powers, especially Syria, Jordan, and Egypt; this militant stance was a source of controversy in the international community, and it also divided Israelis into hawk and dove factions. The intransigence of those hawks, Shlaim shows, served to alienate Israel and made it possible for the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arab nationalist groups to enlist the support of the great powers that Herzl had long before courted. Both sides, in turn, had eventually to face the "historic compromise" that led to the present peace in the Middle East--a peace that, the author suggests, may not endure. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Avi Shlaim is a professor emeritus of international relations at the University of Oxford.

He was a master stylist, employing an extraordinary vocabulary and a rigorous precision in crafting his poems. But he was also a philosopher of aesthetics, vigorously exploring the notion of poetry as the supreme fusion of the creative imagination and objective reality.

But they keep running into a problem--those who were supposed to be liberated by secular gospel that God is Dead aren&#39;t buying it. Why not? Since the Greeks and Romans, as Robert Royal explains, religion has nurtured the development of the individual and of Western culture itself. Christianity and Judaism collaborated to create a dialogue between faith and reason that determined the history of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and Reformation, and several Enlightenments, including our current postmodern moment. Royal concludes that modern democratic societies are intimately tied to a Christian view of the dignity of the human person and the health and survival of free institutions.</p><p>Robert Royal is president of the Faith &amp; Reason Institute in Washington, D.C.

If you give someone just enough nutrition to get by, they won't starve, but some part of them will be dying. In the United States, food is plentiful, but most of it is processed, artificial, and laden with cellular and neurotoxic chemicals, dyes, preservatives, and additives; it is irradiated, fractionated, microwaved, sprayed with pesticides, fungicides, and herbicides; it is stored for long periods or shipped in hot weather; it is contaminated and genetically modified.<br><br>Technically, Americans are not starving to death. In fact, we are eating more than enough calories, but we are getting far too few real nutrients. Like a bird attempting to fly with one wing, we're limping along with symptoms that we've been conditioned to expect and accept. If you want more energy but it seems to be slipping away, you're likely deficient in nutrients. The headache or sense of malaise that keeps you from performing at your peak can be traced directly to your diet.<br><br>"Paradoxically, Americans are becoming both more obese and more nutrient deficient at the same time. . . . But if all you eat is processed food&#x2014;and many Americans do&#x2014;then you will be like the British sailors of the seventeenth century and get scurvy," says Mark Hyman, MD, author of The Blood Sugar Solution.<br><br>Full-blown malnutrition is an identifiable disease with many names. Some examples, in addition to scurvy, are beriberi, rickets, pellagra, and kwashiorkor. These are not often diagnosed in our country, although doctors should be testing for them in children and adults because one cause of pellagra, for example, is a diet high in corn and low in protein. Those who rely on corn as a staple and eat great quantities of popcorn, chips, and cereals are predisposed to pellagra.<br><br>Nutrient deficiencies are rampant in our country. "The price the cell pays for being short of micronutrients is DNA damage, which leads to cancer in the future and ages you faster," warns Bruce Ames, PhD, of the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Ames is a leading voice in the appeal for better health and the prevention of disease through nutritional strategies. Having studied his work and that of many of his colleagues, we are convinced that our country is faced with its own unique malnutrition epidemic, which we call Nutrient Deficiency Disorder (NDD). In the United States, we have enough food to fill our bellies, but our food is nutrient poor, and it is making us sick.<br><br>Dr. Ames believes a nutrient-deficient diet plays a role in just about every disease you can name, especially obesity, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and a vast number of mental disorders. This level of poor nutrition&#x2014;best described as just getting by&#x2014;is a point along the way to full-blown malnutrition. You are low on the nutrients that you need for optimal health, so you obviously have no chance of being optimally healthy. You're like a tire with a leak&#x2014;not yet flat, but bumping along in that direction. You're not at the clinical level of duress, but you have many symptoms that indicate that you're not at your highest level of health, either.<br><br>You may be suffering from high blood pressure. You may be tired all the time, catching every cold and flu bug that comes along. You may be overweight, underweight, anxious, feeling out of sorts and off balance, or walking around with infections you can't shake. You may be peering into the mirror at wrinkles and gray hair long before you expected them to appear. You may have aches and pains. You may have lost interest in sex because you don't feel well enough or have the energy to enjoy it. You're not clinically sick yet, but without a doubt, you're moving in that direction.<br><br>When you are in this stage of physical and mental duress, most doctors can't make heads or tails of what's causing your ailments. As long as you have some air in the tire, to them, it's too soon to diagnose a real problem. You receive a patch for the leak. It's some drug that hopefully might stop it. Unfortunately, it most often comes with side effects, which will only cause additional leaks.<br><br>Most physicians may be unable to address nutrient deficiencies. The courses they study in medical school amount to a pharmaceutical curriculum. They are trained to fix problems with drugs. If you're eating three or more meals a day, the average medical mind isn't trained to consider malnutrition as a cause of your sickness. Even when a doctor checks your blood, he or she compares the results with bare minimum requirements that actually perpetuate your suffering from Nutrient Deficiency Disorder.<br><br>The fact is, the health care system isn't allowing NDD to be diagnosed. Judging from the vending machines and snack tables laden with granola bars and other sweet treats in doctor's offices and hospitals, it's obvious that many of the experts in this system have no clue about the nutrient requirements of your body. They're not even clear about the correct choices of food they themselves need to eat to function at symptom-free levels. You know this is true when you're hospitalized and the food service brings you a tray containing soda and cake and your doctor doesn't even protest.<br><br>In a society like ours, seemingly so advanced and blessed with food abundance, there are three areas of health care policy to scrutinize to see why NDD is one of our biggest health problems. These are:<br><br>1. Artifacts disguised as food<br><br>2. Ridiculous Dietary Reference Intakes<br><br>3. Censorship and profits<br><br>ARE YOU EATING ARTIFACTS?<br><br>In 1940, a very small percentage of our purchased food was processed. Today, that figure is over 90 percent. Processed foods are not foods; they are artifacts, consumed in a society that has been conditioned to accept that industry is the modern mom in the kitchen. Over hundreds of millennia, humans subsisted on natural foods. These can be defined as foods that are growing and alive, or were recently alive, in nature, in the rain and under the sun&#x2014;all plant foods, meat, eggs, and fish. We ate our food within minutes or hours of gathering it, because there was little opportunity for storage. Even when we no longer hunted and gathered, we still planted our foods in the earth or found them in the rivers, pastures, and meadows where we lived. We could see food's authenticity. This "stuff of life" was what we recognized as food through the generations. Until less than a century ago, there was little possibility of the mass manufacturing, packaging, labeling, warehousing, shipping, and advertising that completely drive what we eat today.<br><br>Processed food artifacts include all cereals, sodas, snacks, and breads, as well as canned and packaged foods with long lists of incomprehensible ingredients. Any food made of refined grain and sugar is processed. As are butter substitutes, vegetable oils, and shortenings; deep-fried foods of all kinds; sugared or artificially sweetened soft drinks; all the soy and gluten analogues (including textured vegetable proteins); and all low-fat, animal-free, and fat-free dairy products&#x2014;especially any protein without fat. This last invention&#x2014;the low-fat or fat-free food&#x2014;touted as healthy, wasn't readily available to us before the early 1990s. When it arrived, along with a huge push from the medical community, government agencies, and food manufacturers, obesity rose well past the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention goal, of being under 15 percent, to 33.8 percent. Obesity has more than doubled since the 1960s.<br><br>Protein without fat is an artifact because it's man-made; it is never found that way in nature. Protein and fat are sister nutrients occurring in whole foods. Protein completely devoid of fat is an industrialized product. Genetically modified foods are the height of processing. In this case, the industrialization starts at the level of the DNA of the seed that sprouts the food. Other artifacts of this manufactured family dining experience include the junk and fast food served up in plastic and polystyrene cups and dishes, with plastic spoons, forks, and knives.<br><br>It's now possible to have complete meals of artifacts throughout life. One-third of all calories in the United States are consumed away from home, and they largely come from processed ingredients and are eaten with processed utensils on processed plates. You have no idea what is in your food. And you wonder why your health is plummeting? Most restaurants rely on reheating foods made with the cheapest processed ingredients they can buy. It's all about making food as inexpensive as possible to garner the greatest profits.<br><br>The era of artifact eaters is going to astound archaeologists. They will unearth skeletons with missing teeth, malformed arches, distorted spines, bones full of holes, and malformed joints. When they evaluate the waters and streams of this era, they'll wonder at the toxic residues of seemingly tens of thousands of pharmaceutical drugs. They will probably categorize us as Homo persecutis&#x2014;disenfranchised artifact eaters, victims of profit- driven food industries and the most insane of human missteps: when we left the family kitchen to be convenienced to death and allowed our food to be industrialized.<br><br>Is it true that you can get all the nutrients you need to prevent illness and an early death by eating a balanced diet? How is it possible to eat a balanced diet with a food supply dominated by artifacts? The fact is, the idea of "balanced diet" hardly applies for most of our population. For example, those on a vegan diet (who mistakenly believe that they're on the healthiest path) are eating an unbalanced and highly processed animal-free diet.<br><br>Some experts, like Dr. Ames, believe there is an urgent need to revise the DRI (Dietary Reference Intake, the daily intake level of nutrients required for healthy individuals, similar to the RDA, Recommended Dietary Allowance) and emphasize vitamin supplementation in far higher doses. In an article in the April 2002 issue of the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</i>, Dr. Ames and his colleagues reported that "about 50 human genetic diseases due to defective enzymes can be remedied or ameliorated" through high-dose nutrient therapy, and that therapy can at least partially restore defective enzyme activity.<br><br>A team of physicians and researchers known as the Independent Vitamin Safety Review Panel made the following recommendation to the US government: "Government-sponsored nutrient recommendations, such as the US RDA, are not keeping pace with recent progress in nutrition research. . . . The public has been asked to consume far too little of many . . . key nutrients. Inadequate intake, and inadequate standards to judge intake, have resulted in widespread nutrient inadequacy, chronic disease, and an undernourished but overweight population. . . . Raising the RDA/DRI will save lives and improve health. . . . Clinical and sub-clinical nutrient deficiencies are among the main causes of our society's greatest healthcare problems. Cancer, cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and other diseases are caused or aggravated by poor nutrient intake. The good news is that scientific evidence shows that adequately high consumption of nutrients helps prevent these diseases."<br><br>The panel concluded, "In the past, over-conservative government-sponsored standards have encouraged dietary complacency. People have been led to believe that they can get all the nutrients they need from a 'balanced diet' of processed foods. That is not true. For adequate vitamin and mineral intake, a diet of unprocessed, whole foods, along with the intelligent use of nutritional supplements, is more than just a good idea: it is essential."<br><br>NDD AND CENSORSHIP<br><br>The US National Library of Medicine is the most prestigious archive of scientific findings in the world. It is politically biased and arbitrarily classifies some medical journals as "good" and others as "blacklisted." How does the archive decide what to accept and what to blacklist? We don't know, but the result is that both you and your doctor are deprived of the ability to access decades of peer-reviewed science that can help move you from nutrient deficient to a state of optimal health.<br><br>The "good" journals are easy to access on the Internet through an enormous database called MEDLINE, a free service that is provided by the National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health, both supported by your tax dollars. We're not saying this isn't money well spent&#x2014;unless, that is, you're interested in finding out something about NDD and what doctors have to say about the successful reversal of this underlying cause of disease.<br><br>Since the 1920s, leading biochemists have foreseen impending epidemics of disease. The writing was on the laboratory wall. In an effort to prevent the tragedy now bearing down on us, these scientists published remarkable research on nutrients, in the hope that nutrient awareness would filter down to the public. Specifically, Roger Williams, PhD, of the University of Texas, who discovered many of the B-complex vitamins and authored one of the main textbooks on biochemistry used nationwide in medical schools, lamented that medical doctors weren't interested in nutritional therapies. They preferred more heroic measures, such as surgery and drugs. In a personal crusade for prevention, Dr. Williams wrote seven books on nutrition for the mainstream, turning directly to the general population to prevent increasingly widespread suffering. He was not alone. There were dozens of dedicated biochemists also fighting to be heard, but they were muzzled, prevented from a public discussion on proven, inexpensive, and safe nutritional therapies. This idea simply didn't fit the model of the profit-centered pharmaceutical industry. Nonetheless, the dissenters fought on, because they understood that pharmaceuticals were completely foreign to the biochemistry of the human body. On the other hand, the nutrients these biochemists recommended were identical, nontoxic molecules that comprise the very structure of the human body.<br><br>Two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, PhD, gave these biochemists and other like-minded medical scientists a field of their own when he coined the term orthomolecular medicine, first discussed in Science magazine in 1968. He began to compile their decades of work in the Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine. Published since then, with authoritative research on nutritional therapies rather than drugs, this journal is "blacklisted" today because of the bias against nutritional solutions in favor of pharmaceutical solutions. Even Dr. Pauling's own research in that journal cannot be included in MEDLINE! (Of course, the issue is profits. Nutrients cannot be patented.) You have no access to Dr. Pauling's research in MEDLINE, nor do medical doctors who turn to that database as a resource, nor do journalists. Even the research for which Dr. Pauling won his first Nobel Prize is excluded! Other valuable, life-saving research papers written by equally prestigious scientists and physicians are missing from MEDLINE, too. These are scientists who have discovered how we could use nutrition and nutrients to prevent and reverse some of today's killer diseases.</p><h2>A Reader in International Relations and Political Theory</h2><p>This reader has been assembled in response to increasing dissatisfaction among a growing number of international relations scholars with the currently dominant theory of realism as well as in recognition of the large number of newly independent states which are having to write new constitutions and develop foreign relations.

Disguising herself as a boy, she adopts a new identity as a traveling storyteller called Widsith (far traveler) and reinvents herself, drawing upon the books she has loved all her life. Soon she finds her fate inextricably tied with the dark-eyed King Wilfrid, who knows her only as Widsith, and wants her help in a plot against her own uncle.</p></p><p>Rebecca Tingle lives in Canada.Grade 7 Up - An exciting novel set in 10th-century England. In this sequel to <i>The Edge on the Sword</i> (Putnam, 2001), which ended as King Alfred's daughter, �thelfl�d, was about to marry Ethelred of Mercia, Tingle moves a few years forward to tell of �thelfl�d's 16-year-old daughter, �lfwyn. A scholarly girl with no interest in the riding, swordplay, or politics that absorb her widowed mother, Wyn is surprised to learn that her uncle, the West Saxon King Edward, has arranged her marriage to a much older earl in order to solidify a political alliance. Then her mother's unexpected death throws Mercia's future into a state of uncertainty. With King Wilfrid of Northumbria eager for an alliance with Mercia, Wyn's uncle insists that her marriage take place immediately or that she enter a convent. Knowing that either choice will mean the downfall of her country, Wyn decides instead to flee. Disguised as a boy, she passes herself off as a scop (itinerant bard) and adopts the name Widsith ("Far Traveler"). By chance, she joins King Wilfrid and his men and soon finds herself falling in love with him. When she unwittingly becomes embroiled in Wil's attempts to regain power from her uncle, she must decide where her loyalties lie. This compelling novel is filled with well-researched details, an action-packed plot, and well-drawn and sympathetic characters. Tingle is a worthy successor to Rosemary Sutcliff, sharing her ability to make British history come to life for modern readers.<i> - Ginny Gustin, Sonoma County Library System, Santa Rosa, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Alexander is portrayed as an intelligent, often kind man whose only fault was that he murdered people who resisted his efforts to take their land and money. Cleopatra is depicted as a beautiful dreamer who only wanted an empire to call her own. These titles are superficial to the point of being confusing. Most of the pages are taken up by lifeless, full-color illustrations, and what little text there is paints history with a very broad brush. The subject matter (bloody battles, adultery, treachery) is actually quite mature for easy readers.

Kerrelyn is honored that her band of merry vampires and shifters is spreading love and laughter worldwide in fourteen different languages.</p>The third entry in Sparks's contemporary vampire series, following the kicky <i>Vamps and the City</i>, raises the stakes&#x2014;in more way than one&#x2014;as a vampire hunter unwittingly pushes the vamp underworld to the verge of war. CIA "Stake-Out" agent Emma Watson takes her job personally, having lost her parents to vampires six years earlier. Ambushing vamps in New York City's Central Park, Emma neither suspects nor particularly cares that there are, in fact, two vampire factions: one evil, bent on destroying humanity, and the other good, having eschewed people blood for a synthetic substitute. One of the good guys, Scottish vamp Angus McKay, has been assigned to stop her nightly patrols, but instead finds himself falling in love. Soon Emma's deep-rooted beliefs are coming unmoored: undeniably attracted to Angus, she can't bear the thought of loving&#x2014;or even trusting&#x2014;a vampire, but she's left without a choice when Angus's ex-lover decides to capture them both as a gift to her evil overlord. Sparks's plot, though it lacks the satirical snap of her previous vamp novels, serves the romance between Angus and Emma well. Though it should please her fans, Sparks's latest probably won't win her any new readers in a market saturated with vampire-human love stories. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Consider the Wills home in Mendota Falls, Minnesota, where more than 150 candy canes light up the exterior of the house. Or Bull Run Park in Centerville, Virginia, which features 200 over-the-top holiday lights displays stretching over two miles. And down in Marble Falls, Texas, just about every house in town is a holiday lights extravaganza (including the place with a twirling lariat that spells out ?MERRY TEXMAS Y?ALL?) Okay, so maybe some holiday light shows get a little out of hand, but you have to appreciate the time, work, and effort (not to mention expense) that goes into installing 600,000 bulbs over a 50,000-square-foot property (as in the case of the Clot family of Pinecrest, Florida). And don?t forget the imagination and technical wizardry of homeowners who have created a school of dancing fish wearing Santa hats, or a garden of computer-controlled poinsettias that appear to grow out of the ground and blossom in glorious color, or illuminated toy trains that run on 700 feet of track.<p>HOLIDAY LIGHTS! is a high-wattage celebration of the wildest and most wonderful examples of a modern tradition. The 250 full-color photographs are spectacular, but don?t stop at the pictures. The accompanying essays reveal the titanic amount of hard work and dedication required to install these displays. </p><p>Make this Christmas one your family will remember forever by knitting Christmas stockings for the entire clan.

REVIEW: ...a journalist's objectivity combined with a poet's love of words... -- <i>Juneau Empire, Sept. 24, 1998</i>Simpson's debut collection of essays about Alaska, winner of the 1997 Chinook Literary Prize, combines a refreshing voice and vision in a work that is part adventure, part meditation and part natural history lesson. With her distinctive brand of descriptive journalism, she's informative and captivating, lyrical without ever being maudlin, and philosophic without being preachy. Readers will trust the voice immediately because she speaks the language of the Alaskan landscape. Simpson blurs the line between spectator and participant by living the experiences she writes about, and brings readers with her as she tracks the myths and realities of ravens, moose, bears, wolves and winter itself: "Summer carries you away, but winter inhabits you." She goes beyond symbolism to probe the mystery of Alaska while acknowledging that it's a mystery that can never be solved. She doesn't gloss over vulnerabilities and contradictions of the landscape and animal natureAhumanity and her own included. Ultimately, she wants readers to know that the landscape, although frozen, is alive with activity. "Everything is going somewhere," she writes.

It crackles with suspense and excitement from start to finish.&#x201d;&#x2014;Terry Brooks</b><br><br>Two thousand years ago, the Born Queen defeated the Skasloi lords, freeing humans from the bitter yoke of slavery. But now monstrous creatures roam the land&#x2014;and destinies become inextricably entangled in a drama of power and seduction. The king&#x2019;s woodsman, a rebellious girl, a young priest, a roguish adventurer, and a young man made suddenly into a knight&#x2014;all face malevolent forces that shake the foundations of the kingdom, even as the Briar King, legendary harbinger of death, awakens from his slumber.

Keyes spins his tale in a meticulously crafted fantasy realm on the brink of apocalyptic change. The Briar King, a legend cobbled from children's stories and rural folklore, is waking from his slumber to an unknown but cataclysmic end. Dark agents are afoot in the land, stirring war and edging an ancient prophecy closer to fulfillment. In destiny's path are a king's woodsman, his headstrong lover, a bookworm priest, a cocksure swordsman, and the embattled (from within and without) kingdom of Crotheny. Keyes masterfully intertwines far-off courtly intrigue with the personal quest of the woodsman and his brave companions who seek to unravel the secret of the Briar King before all is lost. <p> Although <i>The Briar King</i> will suffer the inevitable comparison with George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, it should be said that Keyes's work is no mere rip-off. This is excellent world building, applied with a dark, powerful touch that should convince Martin fans to become Keyes fans, too. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>&#x201c;The characters in <i>The Briar King</i> absolutely brim with life.

Stephen Glenn, Ph.D., coauthored the bestselling classics <i>Raising Self-Reliant Children in a Self-Indulgent World</i> and <i>7 Strategies for Developing Capable Students</i>.Chapter 1<br><br>1<br><br>What Is Positive Discipline?<br>As a parent you have a big job. You&#x2019;re the one who helps your children grow up to feel a sense of belonging and connection to the family. You teach your children social and life skills. You help your children feel loved. You find ways to ensure that your children feel special, unique, and important. You keep your children safe.<br><br>How do you do that? With discipline. Perhaps you think of &#x201c;discipline&#x201d; as a means of control through punishment, but Positive Discipline is not about punishment or control. Rather it is about instructing, educating, preparing, training, regulating, skill building, and focusing on solutions. Positive Discipline is constructive, encouraging, affirming, helpful, loving, and optimistic. As children don&#x2019;t come with directions, parents need to find an approach that gives them a sense of confidence.<br><br>Positive Discipline begins at birth and lasts a lifetime. That&#x2019;s right, it&#x2019;s never too early or too late to use Positive Discipline, because it is based on mutually respectful relationships in which you respect your child and you respect yourself. If parenting advice focuses only on the needs of the child and not the needs of the adults, it isn&#x2019;t mutually respectful. That kind of parenting encourages dependence and a lack of courage. If parenting advice focuses only on the needs of the adult and not the needs of the children, that&#x2019;s also not mutually respectful&#x2014;it encourages submission, fear, and rebellion.<br><br>With Positive Discipline, the emphasis is on a balance of firmness and kindness, and on providing respect for both adults and children. Positive Discipline, because it is neither permissive nor punitive, brings hope, increased skills, and love to your family.<br><br>The more tools you have, the more you can teach your children. Part 1 is a reference to give you an understanding of the twenty-seven basic tools of Positive Discipline. These twenty-seven tools are referred to throughout the book, so be sure to read Part 1 before starting on the specific problems.<br><br>Be Kind and Firm<br><br>Many parents are plagued with guilt. That&#x2019;s because they are either too controlling (&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the boss&#x201d;) or too permissive (&#x201c;Call me milquetoast&#x201d;). Some parents are a combination of controlling and permissive, vacillating between the two extremes but not being consistent. Positive Discipline parents are neither. They practice firmness coupled with kindness. Which of the following styles fits for you?<br><br>The Boss: You have all the power and your kids should obey you simply because you&#x2019;re the parent.<br><br>Milquetoast: Your children are the center of the universe, so they have all the power.<br><br>Kind and Firm: Your child is part of your family, not the center of the universe. You know your child&#x2019;s personality and can create boundaries without breaking your child&#x2019;s spirit.<br><br>Still not sure which is your style? Here are more clues. Both the boss and milquetoast act instead of being proactive. That means that they wait till something happens and respond to it in the moment. Kind and Firm parents take a step back, observe and think before they act. They work on ways to show their child what to do instead of constantly saying YES! or NO! The Boss often looks for blame or fault and relies on punishment as the primary discipline tool. Kind and Firm parents look for solutions instead of blame and realize that the person who can and must change first is the parent. By changing yourself even in the smallest ways, you can positively influence your child&#x2019;s behavior.<br><br>Milquetoast parents spend a lot of energy on what they shoulda, coulda, or woulda done. They tend to feel sorry for their children when they mess up, and are unwilling to let a child learn from his or her behavior. If this is your style, your child is parenting you instead of you providing leadership for the family. You are overprotective and you lack faith in your child&#x2019;s ability to learn and grow. You are not giving your child many opportunities to develop the belief &#x201c;I am capable.&#x201d; Guilt is your middle name.<br><br>When you use the tools of Positive Discipline, you become the Kind and Firm parent, and you banish guilt from your life. You give yourself and your child permission to make mistakes, to be imperfect, and to try again, and again, and again. Why? Because you know that mistakes are the best teacher and that it is human to make them.<br><br>Kind and Firm parenting happens one step at a time. Reflect on your strengths and the strengths of your family. Then think of the areas you&#x2019;d like to improve, and work on one issue at a time. That way you won&#x2019;t overwhelm yourself or your children.<br><br>Decide What You Will Do,<br><br>and Then Do It<br><br>The heart of Positive Discipline is learning to change yourself instead of trying to control others and make them change. If you&#x2019;ve been busy trying to control your children, you probably haven&#x2019;t considered the possibility that you can deal with problems by controlling your own behavior and deciding what you will do instead of what you will try to make your children do.<br><br>Once you begin to focus on changing your behavior, you soon realize that actions must accompany your words and you have to follow through on your decisions. So that you don&#x2019;t paint yourself into any corners, it&#x2019;s best to think before you open your mouth. Rather than saying things you don&#x2019;t really mean and finding yourself in the middle of the muddle, take a step back, and give the matter your full attention. This will help you ignore minor interruptions and deal with the ones that are really important to you.<br><br>Here are some examples of &#x201c;Deciding What You Will Do&#x201d; in action:<br><br>�A mother of an eleven-month-old baby who struggled through diaper changing decided to stop fighting with her child. Instead she said, &#x201c;I need your help. I&#x2019;ll wait till you are ready to lie still while I change your diaper.&#x201d; Each time her child struggled, she stopped, and without speaking, waited quietly until her baby stopped wiggling. The minute the wiggles stopped, she went back to the diaper change. It took a few times before her child started to help with the process and stay still. She showed no anger, but simply waited patiently, keeping her child safe on the changing table.<br><br>�Another parent found that she was repeating herself all the time, and she realized that no one seemed to be listening to her. After some thought, she told her children that she would make sure she had their full attention and then say things one time. If they had questions, she&#x2019;d be happy to answer them, but she was no longer going to repeat herself. She stuck to her guns, and soon noticed how much better her children listened when she said something. If they weren&#x2019;t paying attention, they would ask one of their siblings what Mom had said.<br><br>�A parent noticed that his kids were putting off their homework until just before bedtime, and then asking for help. He told them he would be available to help with homework every night between seven and nine. The first time one of his kids came to him at 9:30 to start studying for a test, he smiled and said, &#x201c;I know you need my help, and I am happy to help you between seven and nine any night of the week. This time you&#x2019;re on your own.&#x201d; It is so easy for a parent to feel sorry for a child at this point, or think it is best to give more chances (after the &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; lecture). But you can make the problem much better if you have the courage to follow through on your commitment, because you are allowing your child to learn from her behavior. Keep in mind that this only works if you skip the nagging, reminding, and lectures.<br><br>�Many parents have learned how to avoid unsafe driving by pulling the car to the side of the road and waiting quietly until the children settle down. Shopping trip tantrums have been avoided when parents take their children to sit in the car the moment the whining or tantrums start. All the parent says is, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go back as soon as you are ready.&#x201d; Others have sidestepped fights and crying jags by clearly stating that they don&#x2019;t make loans and sticking to it, allowing their children to learn to budget their allowance. Saying and meaning that the car doesn&#x2019;t move until everyone is buckled safely into the seat belt puts a stop to endless power struggles.<br><br>It&#x2019;s very tempting to repeat yourself, remind, and explain instead of following through with action. Kind and Firm parents save their words to talk about how wonderful their children are, or to engage in conversations about interesting topics, or to explain how life works.<br><br>Act, Don&#x2019;t Talk<br><br>Another variation on the &#x201c;decide what you will do&#x201d; method of parenting is to act instead of talking. Listen to yourself for one day. You might be amazed how many useless words you say. Or listen to parents bargaining with their kids at the grocery store, begging them at the department store, nagging them at the park, and explaining endlessly to them when it&#x2019;s time to move from point A to point B. Over 75 percent of the problems parents have with young children would probably disappear if parents talked less and acted more. Children tune parents out because parents talk too much.<br><br>This parenting by words (&#x201c;Do this&#x201d; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that&#x201d;) is a way parents mistakenly turn power over to children who tune them out and don&#x2019;t do a thing they say. These parents then label their children as disobedient instead of acknowledging that they themselves are not using effective parenting skills. It is perfectly okay to take children by the hand and start walking, or lift them up and carry them to bed, or set them in the tub when they are having a fit about taking a bath. It is disrespectful to yell, nag, lecture, beg, order, and threat...</p><h2>Salvador Dali, 1904-1989</h2><p>Used. Very Good conditions.

What&#x2019;s more, when Christmas did arrive, they celebrated not just for one day but for twelve! So four weeks for Advent and nearly two weeks for Christmas makes six weeks, which is why Ann Spangler has prepared this six-week Christmas devotional. Drawing from her bestselling books Praying the Names of God and Praying the Names of Jesus, Spangler selected six names or titles&#x2014;including Immanuel, Yeshua, and Bright Morning Star. Each name offers a week&#x2019;s worth of devotions focusing on God, the miraculous birth of his son, and the promise of his return. In Immanuel, you&#x2019;ll discover a perfect balance of prayer, reflection, and study to help you open your heart fully to the birth of Jesus and all that it means.</p></p><p><p>Ann Spangler is an award-winning writer and the author of many bestselling books, including <em>Praying the Names of God, Women of the Bible</em> and <em>Sitting at the Feet of Rabbi Jesus</em>.

We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out."<br></em><br>Roger Ebert is the best-known film critic of our time. He has been reviewing films for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em> since 1967, and was the first film critic ever to win a Pulitzer Prize. He has appeared on television for four decades.<br><br>In 2006, complications from thyroid cancer treatment resulted in the loss of his ability to eat, drink, or speak. But with the loss of his voice, Ebert has only become a more prolific and influential writer. And now, for the first time, he tells the full, dramatic story of his life and career.<br><br>In this candid, personal history, Ebert chronicles it all: his loves, losses, and obsessions; his struggle and recovery from alcoholism; his marriage; his politics; and his spiritual beliefs. He writes about his years at the <em>Sun-Times</em>, his colorful newspaper friends, and his life-changing collaboration with Gene Siskel. He shares his insights into movie stars and directors like John Wayne and Martin Scorsese.<br><br>This is a story that only Roger Ebert could tell. Filled with the same deep insight, dry wit, and sharp observations that his readers have long cherished, this is more than a memoir -- it is a singular, warm-hearted, inspiring look at life itself.<br><br><em></em></p><p>Roger Ebert won the Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 1975, and his reviews were syndicated in newspapers around the world. He was cohost of Siskel &amp; Ebert and Ebert &amp; Roeper for thirty-three years, and was a managing editor and reviewer for Ebert Presents At the Movies. He was the author of seventeen books, including Scorsese by Ebert and Awake in the Dark. Roger Ebert was also an honorary member of the Directors Guild of America. He received the Carl Sandburg Literary Award of the Chicago Public Library and won the Webby Awards Person of the Year in 2010. His website, rogerebert.com, receives 110 million visits a year. He lived with his wife, Chaz Hammelsmith Ebert, in Chicago. Roger Ebert passed away in 2013."Ebert is exceptionally good company. Like Christopher Hitchens and Kirk Douglas, he works prodigiously and narrates his Job-like woes with a surprisingly chipper voice....and a captivating, moveable feast it is."&#x2015;<b><i>Maureen Dowd, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></i></b><br><br>"As Ebert notes in his new autobiography, "Life Itself," his silence has made his inner voice more vivid, and-as he himself says in his introduction-the book is proof of it. In particular, he summons his youth (he was born in 1942) and those who were close to him then-family, friends, neighbors, teachers-with a wealth of detail that is at once a tribute to the vigorous fullness with which he has lived and to his power of perception, recollection, and description. ...The treasure of the book is Ebert's portraiture-whether of family, friends, colleagues, or celebrities. He speaks lovingly of actors ("I am beneath everything else a fan. I was fixed in this mode as a young boy and am awed by people who take the risks of performance"); in particular, his sketches of Robert Mitchum, Lee Marvin, and John Wayne pulsate with life (they're juicily quotable, but I won't bother quoting; just do read them), and he conjures a remarkable character, Billy "Silver Dollar" Baxter, a former wheeler-dealer at the Cannes Film Festival who, Ebert writes, now "lives not far from Broadway, which is to Billy as the stream is to the trout...." The dialogue Ebert reproduces is a comic masterwork; I feel as if I'm seeing a version of the American tycoon from Jacques Tati's "Playtime," only smarter, raunchier, and more inventive: <em>Irving! Take care of Francis Ford Chrysler over there! And set 'em up for Prince Albert in a can! Whatever he's having. Doo-blays!"</em>&#x2015;<b><i>Richard Brody, <em>The New Yorker</em></i></b><br><br>"Candid, funny and kaleidoscopic...This is the best thing Mr. Ebert has ever written...The book sparkles with his new, improvisatory, written version of dinner-party conversation...Its globe-trotting, indefatigable author comes across as the life of a lifelong party."&#x2015;<b><i>Janet Maslin, <em>The New York Times</em></i></b><br><br>"Ebert is best known, of course, as the nation's most prominent film critic; but in recent years he's turned to exploring more personal concerns on his widely read blog, leading to this poignant memoir. Five years ago, surgeries following thyroid cancer left him unable to speak, eat, or drink, but as he recounts, he "began to replace what I lost with what I remembered." This enhanced recall allows him to relate with exhaustive detail his halcyon if unremarkable childhood in a small town in the Midwest and his life changing college days. When the narrative turns to journalism and, inevitably, movies, as Ebert falls into his reviewing gig at the Chicago Sun-Times in 1967, the focus becomes sharper, and even the tangential chapters-devoted to topics ranging from his encounters with film legends to his stormy relationship with TV partner Gene Siskel-are cogently engaging. But it's the most personal segments, dealing with his struggle with alcoholism, his supportive wife, Chaz, and his recent illness, that give the book its considerable emotional heft. Ebert illuminates and assesses his life with the same insight and clarity that marks his acclaimed movie reviews."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Booklist </em>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"It's hardly surprising that Ebert, the Pulitzer Prize-winning film critic for the Chicago Sun-Times since 1967, begins this candid examination of an extraordinary life with an allusion to Ingmar Bergman's Persona, about an actress who loses her voice in mid-performance. Though three thyroid cancer surgeries resulting in the removal of his lower jaw have left Ebert unable to speak, eat, or drink, these are not famous last words. Forgoing a traditional linear format, each chapter--particularly "My Old Man" and "Big John Wayne"--could function as a stand-alone essay. Born in Urbana, Ill., in 1942, Ebert spent a carefree childhood, often with his nose in a book. Drawn to newspapers beginning in high school, he became the sports reporter for his school paper before rising to the rank of co-editor. The position of film critic fell into his lap at the Sun-Times--a paper he joined after leaving a graduate English program--and Ebert hasn't looked back. And while films have governed his life for close to 50 years, he wisely doesn't choose the greatest hits version of his reviewing career, focusing instead on the life he's lived in between screenings: his battle with alcoholism; tight-knit friendships forged in the newsroom (and bar); and his marriage to Chaz, whom he calls "the great fact of my life." Hollywood gets its due, but it's an ensemble player, sharing the screen with reminiscences both witty and passionate from one of our most important cultural voices."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publisher's Weekly</em> (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"Thoughtful, entertaining, and emotional...Ebert comes across as smart, bighearted, and eccentric...and writes with unflinching candor about difficult subjects."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Entertainment Weekly</em> (A-)</i></b><br><br>"Tales from childhood, interviews with film stars and directors, funny and touching stories about colleagues, and evocative essays about trips unspool before the reader in a series of loosely organized, often beautifully written essays crafted by a witty, clear-eyed yet romantic raconteur....Ebert's work as a film critic sent him traveling, and his wonderfully personal essays on places around the world where he seeks solitude are highlights of the book, rich in reflections, imagery and sensory detail."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Washington Post</em></i></b><br><br>"A gentle look back, "Life Itself: A Memoir" is as moving as it is amusing, fresh evidence that Roger Ebert is a writer who happens to love movies, not a movie lover who happens to write."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Associated Press</em></i></b><br><br>"Ebert's new memoir, "Life Itself," is an episodic, impressionistic and skillfully written exploration of his life, from his 1950s childhood in Urbana, Ill., to his recent battles against thyroid cancer, which have left him unable to speak, or to eat or drink through his mouth. What shines throughout the book is Ebert's humility, his down-to-earth and powerful sense of decency."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em></i></b><br><br>"So he lost his speech but not his voice; it rings out with greater clarity and authority than ever."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Time Magazine</em></i></b></p><h2>Wouldn&#39;t Take Nothing for My Journey Now (LEATHER BOUND)</h2><p>Elegant special edition of Angelou classic, BOUND IN BROWN LEATHER, GOLD COVER TEXT, GILT EDGES, GOLD RIBBON PLACEKEEPER. 5 1/2 x 8.</p><p></p><h2>Jeanne Rose&#39;s Herbal Guide to Food</h2><p>with 140 recipes</p><p></p><h2>The Magician&#39;s Apprentice</h2><p><b>Taking place hundreds of years before the events of <i>The Magicians' Guild, The Magician's Apprentice </i>is the new novel set in the world of Trudi Canavan's Black Magician trilogy.</b> <p></p>In the remote village of Mandryn, Tessia serves as assistant to her father, the village Healer.

Clean tight and unmarked first edition in price intact jacket.</p><p>Michael Crichton was a writer and filmmaker, best known as the author of Jurassic Park and the creator of ER. One of the most popular entertainers in the world, Crichton sold more than 200 million copies of his books which have been translated into 40 languages and adapted into 15 films. Long before the carefully researched techno-thrillers that ultimately brought him to fame, Crichton wrote high-octane suspense novels to support himself while studying at Harvard Medical School. He published eight of these books under the pseudonym John Lange between the years of 1966 and 1972. They provided him with the means to complete his education. He graduated at the top of his class.A man who thinks of himself as a political activist, but who appears to be more like a terrorist, has big plans nearing fruition. An American federal agent is keeping an eye on him, hoping to uncover the details of the man&#x2019;s plot. When some deadly nerve gas goes missing, the American agent thinks he&#x2019;s solved the mystery, but is it already too late? Between the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Crichton published a handful of actioners under the name of John Lange. They&#x2019;re mostly straightforward thrillers, usually with a distinct pulp-fiction flavor to them (fast-paced action, slick stories, slightly larger-than-life characters). They don&#x2019;t really resemble a Michael Crichton novel, although this one, from 1972&#x2014;three years after Crichton published The Andromeda Strain under his own name&#x2014;just might come closer than the other Lange novels. Science and technology are key elements in the story, and some of the writing has that familiar Crichton feel to it. A well-constructed race-against-time thriller. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Gathering of the Waters</h2><p>One of the dramatic occurences of the last days, according to the Book of Zechariah in the Bible, will be when the Mount of Olives cleaves into two parts, opening up an avenue of escape for the Jewish people during the Battle of Armageddon. At about the same time, and possibly in much the same way, the legendary ten tribes of Israel will return from the north. Some kind of barrier, such as a mountain of rock and ice, will cleave apart before them, creating a passageway from an unknown region to the outside world! <p>The predicted event at the Mount of Olives, surrounded by mystery and the supernatural, gives credibility to the idea that the return of the ten tribes will likewise be a miraculous occurence. There is also the implication that the tribes will be coming from a very unusual place, one far removed from ordinary circumstances. Although some believe they are currently living a normal kind of life and will someday reappear in a conventional manner, the evidence apprears otherwise. What little is known about this mysterious group of people points more toward events and phenomena that are extemely extraordinary!</p></p><p>Clay McConkie is a native of Utah. he is a teacher by occpation, having taught in the Salt Lake City Schools for thirty years.

The result of these varying felicities is a novel that is immediate, strikingly unpredictable, authentic, and convincing.&nbsp;</p></p><p>"<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> is the great American novel. Search no further." --Martin Amis, <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i><p> Originally published in 1953, Saul Bellow's modern picaresque tale grandly illustrates twentieth-century man's restless pursuit of an elusive meaning. Augie March, a young man growing up in Chicago during the Great Depression, doesn't understand success on other people's terms. Fleeing to Mexico in search of something to fill his restless soul and soothe his hunger for adventure, Augie latches on to a wild succession of occupations until his journey brings him full circle. Yet beneath Augie's carefree nature lies a reflective person with a strong sense of responsibility to both himself and others, who in the end achieves a success of his own making. A modern-day Columbus, Augie March is a man searching not for land but for self and soul and, ultimately, for his place in the world.</p><p> "A book of extraordinary and massive power ... plainly one of the richest of twentieth-century American novels." --Alfred Kazin</p><p> "[Bellow's] body of work is more capacious of imagination and language than anyone else's.... If there's a candidate for the great American novel, I think this is it." --Salman Rushdie, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)</p><p> "The best postwar American novel, <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> magnificently terminates and fulfills the line of Melville, Twain, and Whitman." --James Wood, <i>The New Republic</i></p><b>SAUL BELLOW</b> (1915-2005) is the only novelist to receive three National Book Awards, for&nbsp;<i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>,&nbsp;<i>Herzog</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Sammler's Planet</i>.

Scientists tried to tame it, break its will, and even change its very being with surgery and torture, but the beast rebelled, killing nearly all in its way. But was the creature truly a throwback, a freak survivor of some prehistoric era-or was it something more? Six decades later, one scientist attempts to find out, using a time machine to journey into the past. What he finds not only shatters his vision of what the Creature might be, but could change the history of the human race forever. Paul Di Filippo reinvents the Creature with a tale of time travel, horror, and mystery that blends Cold War science fiction with today&#39;s cutting edge cyberpunk.</p><p></p><h2>The Rebellious Slave: Nat Turner in American Memory</h2><p>In this detailed study spanning the eras of slavery, Jim Crow, and civil rights, Scot French places the contested history and enduring memory of Nat Turner&#39;s Rebellion within the broader context of the black freedom struggle. French builds his narrative around close readings of historical texts, both famous and obscure, from early American prophecies of slave rebellion to William Styron&#39;s 1967 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Turner. He devotes considerable attention to the interplay between quasi-official narratives, such as &#34;The Confessions of Nat Turner&#34; by Thomas R. Gray, and less authoritative sources, such as rumor and oral tradition. Whereas most historians accept &#34;The Confessions&#34; as gospel, French presents several compelling counternarratives that point to a wider conspiracy. A groundbreaking work of American history, analogous to Merrill D. Peterson&#39;s Lincoln in American Memory and Nell Painter&#39;s Sojourner Truth: A Life, a Symbol, The Rebellious Slave will alter our views of both slavery and its complex, everchanging legacy.</p><p>Scot French is an assistant professor and associate director of the Carter G. Woodson Institute for African-American and African Studies at the University of Virginia.INTRODUCTION<br><br>This will be a very noted day in Virginia," Governor John Floyd wrote in his <br>diary entry for the twenty-third day of August, 1831. "At daylight this morning <br>the Mayor of the City put into my hands a notice to the public, written by <br>James Trezvant of Southampton County, stating that an insurrection of the <br>slaves in that county had taken place, that several families had been <br>massacred and that it would take a considerable military force to put them <br>down." Eyewitness reports from the scene of "massacre and devastation" <br>defied belief. Mutilated corpses &#x2014; men, women, and children, blacks and <br>whites, slaves and masters &#x2014; littered the landscape. "Like the head of <br>Medusa," wrote one awestruck observer, "it can scarcely be looked on <br>without converting the spectacle into marble."<br> First the white people fell. "Between eighty and a hundred of the <br>whites have already been butchered &#x2014; their heads severed from their <br>bodies," read one hastily written dispatch from a military encampment in <br>neighboring Greensville County. "We saw several children whose brains were <br>knocked out," a mounted volunteer from Norfolk reported. "Whole families, <br>father, mother, daughters, sons, sucking babes, and school children, <br>butchered, thrown into heaps, and left to be devoured by dogs and hogs, or to <br>putrify on the spot," observed a member of a Richmond cavalry troop. At one <br>house, a military officer found the bodies of "an old lady and six others" <br>strewn about the yard, "chopped to pieces with axes, the tree fences and <br>house top covered with buzzards preying on the carcasses." Horrified, he <br>could not bring himself to visit other nearby houses, "altho" there were several <br>other families in sight, in the same situation."<br> Then the black people fell. "From the best information," a North <br>Carolina newspaper reported, "32 dead bodies [negroes] have been seen, <br>besides a number are supposed to have died in the woods of their wounds." <br>The senior editor of the Richmond Whig, who traveled to Southampton <br>County as a member of a cavalry troop, deplored "the slaughter of many <br>blacks, without trial, and under circumstances of great barbarity." He <br>estimated the number killed in that manner &#x2014; "generally by decapitation or <br>shooting" &#x2014; at forty, perhaps higher. The Lynchburg Virginian reported <br>that "troops under the command of Gen. Broadnax, had slain upwards of 90 <br>blacks, taken the leader in that section prisoner, shot him, cut off his head <br>and limbs, and hung them in different sections, to inspire a salutary terror <br>among the slaves." The Raleigh Register reported that "two leaders were shot <br>and their heads placed upon stakes in the public road."<br> White civil and military authorities, anxious to restore order, <br>sought to minimize the extent of the rebellion and the threat of renewed <br>attack. Geographically, they confined the trouble to a single "neighborhood" <br>or "infected district" within Southampton County. Chronologically, they <br>represented the uprising as a brief, spontaneous act, with little planning and <br>no clear motive behind it. Militarily, they insisted that all but a few of the <br>insurgents had been captured or killed. Early reports of four hundred armed <br>insurgents gave way to revised estimates of no more than forty or fifty at <br>best, many of them young boys coerced into joining. The confessions of <br>prisoners and the interrogation of eyewitnesses pointed to an even smaller <br>cadre of ringleaders &#x2014; "the celebrated Nelson, called by the blacks, "Gen. <br>Nelson,"" "Will Artist, a free man of color," and "General Nat Turner (a <br>preacher and a slave)," chief among them.<br> As the other suspected ringleaders fell, the stature of Nat Turner <br>rose. It was he, the Richmond newspapers reported, who had masterminded <br>the whole affair.<br><br>A fanatic preacher by the name of Nat Turner (Gen. Nat Turner) who had <br>been taught to read and write, and permitted to go about preaching in the <br>country, was at the bottom of this infernal brigandage. He was artful, <br>impudent and vindictive, without any cause or provocation that could be <br>assigned. (Richmond Enquirer, August 30, 1831)<br><br>This Nat seems to be a bold fellow, of the deepest cunning, who for years <br>has been endeavoring to acquire an influence over the minds of those deluded <br>wretches. He reads and writes with ease, it is said, and has long been a <br>preacher. Superstitious himself, his object has been to operate upon the <br>superstitious hopes and fears of others; and the late singular phenomenon of <br>the Sun, enabled him to fill their minds with the most anxious forebodings, <br>regarding it as an omen from Heaven, that their cause would result <br>prosperously. (Richmond Compiler, September 3, 1831)<br><br> Thus, within two weeks of the uprising, an image of the rebel <br>leader as a "fanatic preacher" with extraordinary powers of persuasion had <br>already begun to take form. Turner"s ability to elude capture despite a <br>massive manhunt only added to his mystique. "Who is this Nat Turner?" the <br>editors of the Richmond Enquirer asked. "Where is he from?"<br> Turner eluded capture for more than two months, finally <br>surrendering to a poor white farmer who found him hiding in a makeshift cave. <br>A local lawyer, Thomas R. Gray, interviewed Turner in his jail cell, recorded <br>his purported "Confessions," and published them as a pamphlet shortly after <br>Turner was executed. The Virginia General Assembly, responding to public <br>outcry in the immediate aftermath of the rebellion, debated plans for the <br>gradual abolition of slavery and the removal of all free persons of color from <br>the Commonwealth. In the end, state legislators decided by a slim majority <br>to defer action on such sweeping reforms and instead passed measures <br>aimed at tightening control over the slave population. Memories of "Old Nat"s <br>War," preserved in officially sanctioned histories and submerged oral <br>traditions, stirred emotions and spurred debate for generations to come.<br> What follows is neither a traditional biography of Nat Turner nor a <br>definitive account of Nat Turner"s Rebellion. This is a book about America"s <br>search for transcendent meaning in its troubled past, with a focus on the <br>larger-than-life figure of the rebellious slave. The stories told here, spanning <br>two centuries, illuminate a multicultural discourse on race, slavery, and <br>revolutionary violence rooted in common claims to America"s founding myths, <br>symbols, and traditions.<br> Part I examines the evolving image of the rebellious slave in <br>American thought from the period of the American Revolution through the <br>cataclysmic events of 1831. The jeremiads of Thomas Jefferson, David <br>Walker, and William Lloyd Garrison anticipated the appearance of a black <br>Spartacus and warned of a coming race war should Americans fail to <br>eradicate slavery. Part II focuses on the official inquiry into Turner"s Rebellion <br>and the making of a master narrative designed to tranquilize an agitated <br>public and facilitate the restoration of order throughout the region. The <br>declarations of key participant observers &#x2014; a Richmond newspaper editor, a <br>Southampton County slave girl, the governor of Virginia &#x2014; reveal the deadly <br>uncertainties that prevailed before the publication of Nat Turner"s so-<br>called "Confessions" put rumors of a wider conspiracy to rest. Part III charts <br>the evolving image of Turner as an American icon &#x2014; alternately revered and <br>reviled, embraced and distanced &#x2014; through the eras of slavery and <br>emancipation, civil war and reconstruction, Jim Crow and civil rights. <br>Slaveholders, abolitionists, advocates of black uplift, defenders of white <br>supremacy, New Negroes, New Dealers, civil rights pacifists, Black Power <br>militants &#x2014; all enlisted Turner, at one time or another, as hero or villain. The <br>literary-historical controversy surrounding William Styron"s 1967 novel, The <br>Confessions of Nat Turner, commands extended treatment, as it remains the <br>single most influential work on the subject, overshadowing even the <br>original "Confessions" in public consciousness today.<br> The concept of social or collective memory undergirds this study. <br>Historical in focus, it asks: How have various individuals and social groups <br>within American society imagined themselves and their relationship to one <br>another by reference to the event known as "Nat Turner"s Rebellion"? How <br>has the image of Turner, as depicted in American history, literature, and <br>folklore, responded to the changing needs of society and shifting currents in <br>American thought?<br> Scholars have long recognized that history &#x2014; "the memory of <br>things said and done" &#x2014; represents society"s ongoing search for a useable <br>past. As Carl Becker wrote more than seventy years ago, "every generation, <br>our own included, will, must inevitably, understand the past and anticipate <br>the future in the light of its own restricted experience, must inevitably play on <br>the dead whatever tricks it finds necessary for its own peace of mind." The <br>historian Merrill D. Peterson applied this insight to his classic study The <br>Jefferson Image in the American Mind (1960), which charted the postmortem <br>career of Thomas Jefferson as a popular cultural icon. "This is not a book on <br>the history Thomas Jefferson made," Peterson explained in the preface, "but <br>a book on what history made of Thomas Jefferson." More recently, historians <br>have employed the concept of social or collective memory "to explore how a <br>social group, be it a family, a class, or a nation, constructs a past through a <br>process of invention and appropriation and what it means to the relationship <br>of power within society." Much of this scholarly literature, Alon Confino writes <br>in The Nation As Local Metaphor (1997), has focused on conflicts within and <br>between dominant and subordinate groups over "who wants whom to <br>remember what, and why." Yet memory, he notes, can also illuminate the <br>broad planes of consensus that hold nations and other "imagined <br>communities" together.<br> My long-standing interest in conflicting perceptions of the past, <br>piqued by the controversy over Styron"s fictionalized representation of Turner, <br>led me first to the study of another historical figure associated with race and <br>slavery: Thomas Jefferson. In 1992 my friend and colleague Edward L. Ayers <br>invited me to coauthor an article for a volume of essays titled Jeffersonian <br>Legacies, a retrospective look at the slaveholding statesman on the two <br>hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his birth. The article surveyed changing <br>American attitudes toward Jefferson from 1943 to 1993, picking up where <br>Merrill Peterson left off in his classic study. Ayers and I were struck by the <br>diminishing cultural authority of professional historians in shaping perceptions <br>of the American past. Jefferson"s rumored sexual liaisons with his slave <br>mistress Sally Hemings, long dismissed as a groundless slander by his <br>biographers yet preserved as fact in black oral tradition, became the focal <br>point of public debates over Jefferson"s character and the nation"s willingness <br>to accept a counternarrative at odds with the official portrait. Jefferson"s <br>biographers found their claims to scholarly objectivity increasingly challenged <br>by popular writers who embraced black oral tradition and the emerging image <br>of Jefferson as the all-too-human father of a mixed-race country. The "tricks" <br>that all parties to the debate played on the past shook my faith in objectivity <br>as an oft-stated principle of historical inquiry. I came away convinced that the <br>lines between history, a scholarly discipline based on rules of evidence, and <br>memory, its popular but unruly cousin, were far blurrier than commonly <br>believed.<br> The Jeffersonian Legacies article revealed cracks and fissures in <br>America"s heroic self-image, which I probe more deeply in this study of Nat <br>Turner"s Rebellion in history and memory. Turner himself plays a critical role <br>as the reputed leader and mastermind of the rebellion, yet the focus is less <br>on him than on those who lay claim to his story. As Turner recedes into <br>history, various people, both famous and obscure, assume key roles as <br>guardians of his memory. The stories they tell &#x2014; recorded and preserved in <br>public records, private letters, books and articles, visual imagery and <br>dramatic reenactments &#x2014; reveal intense struggles for social power and <br>cultural authority in a socially stratified, culturally diverse nation.<br> While my work is informed by a growing body of scholarship on <br>the subject of Turner"s Rebellion in history and memory, it draws inspiration <br>from sources outside the academy as well. Like Rashomon, the 1950 murder-<br>mystery by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, my study offers no single <br>accounting of the incident in question, but rather a series of prophecies and <br>flashbacks in which expert witnesses with varying degrees of cultural <br>authority imagine and reimagine the scene. It offers no clear resolution to the <br>problem of misleading or conflicting testimony, leaving readers with a nagging <br>sense of insecurity about what can be known with any certainty about the <br>past. I found another muse in the Tom Stoppard play Rosencrantz and <br>Guildenstern Are Dead, which puts the spotlight on two minor characters <br>from Shakespeare"s Hamlet. In like fashion, my study of Nat Turner shifts the <br>spotlight from the center to the periphery, from the well-established <br>protagonist to other, relatively minor characters with varying degrees of <br>proximity to the "main event." It analyzes the public testimony offered by <br>these bit players for insights into the worlds in which they lived. It follows <br>them offstage, whenever possible, and eavesdrops on their conversations with <br>others. Finally, The Return of Martin Guerre, a French film based on a <br>legendary case of stolen identity, provided me with a historical analogy. A <br>small village must decide whether a man claiming to be the long-lost Martin <br>Guerre is who he says he is. I see the "return" of Martin Guerre as something <br>of a metaphor for the reappearance of Nat Turner, in various literary-historical <br>guises, over the course of two centuries. With each celebrated "return," the <br>public must ask: Is this the real Nat Turner &#x2014; or a clever imposter?<br> Turner was neither the first nor the last American slave to conspire <br>against his would-be masters, yet he stands alone in American thought as <br>the epitome of the rebellious slave, a black messiah whose words and deeds <br>challenged the slaveholding South and awakened a slumbering nation. A <br>maker of history in his own day, Turner has been made to serve the most <br>pressing needs of every generation since. In remembering Nat Turner, we are <br>forced to confront &#x2014; or deftly evade, at our peril &#x2014; the intertwined legacies of <br>slavery and racial oppression in a nation founded on revolutionary ideals of <br>freedom and equality.<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Scot French.

This time, the doctor has his fun at the expense of such political figures as Washington, Napoleon, Hitler, and Churchill; royals such as Queen Victoria and Germany's Frederick III; literary luminaries from Boswell to Proust; and assorted others, including van Gogh, Freud, and Sherlock Holmes. Aware that Washington's ownership of false teeth is a familiar story, Gordon enlarges the retelling by informing us of 18th-century dental practice-- transplants from cadavers, dentures from walrus tusks--thereby making us value dentistry's advances in recent times. The notion of medicine's progress permeates Gordon's accounts, for the treatments that 17th- and 18th-century doctors inflicted on patients-- purgatives, enemas, bleedings, cuppings, and numerous foul concoctions--now seem not merely ineffective but downright death-promoting. Perhaps even more terrifying is the idea of surgery without anesthesia; Gordon's graphic description of the operation Pepys endured for removal of bladder stones sticks in the mind. Clever and gossipy, Gordon's brief anecdotes are full of name-dropping and sexual tittle-tattle: Boswell had gonorrhea, Carlyle was impotent, Florence Nightingale was a lesbian, and Hitler had only a right testicle. It is relief to come to the last chapter, where Gordon has the most fun of all with fictional figures. Dr. Watson's letter to Freud about his neurotic friend Holmes is a gem, as is Freud's reply. Discovering the human frailties of notable men and women (Byron had sclerosis of the liver, Proust suffered from mother-fixation, Elizabeth Barrett Browning was anorexic) does little to increase appreciation of their work but certainly cuts them down to size. For the most part, this is pretty low stuff, the National Enquirer for history buffs. (24 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Those already acquainted with Gordon's writing, in the venerable British humor magazine <i>Punch</i> or any of his 45 books, know his clever literary allusions, delightful wit, and amusing contradictions and ironies (e.g., this opening sentence: "Paganini became a difficult patient only when he was dead"). As in his other works, his historical knowledge herein proves solid, often surprising, and always pertinent. You may think that George Washington, Hitler, FDR, Boswell, Whitman, Shaw, and similar worthies have probably had their medical histories worked to death, so to speak, but such is not the case. Gordon consistently comes up with remarkable details and presents them in an enlightening and enjoyable manner, making of them one of those rare books to be gulped whole or consumed in bits and pieces with equal pleasure. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>The Middle Stories</h2><p>Part Dorothy Parker, part Jos� Saramago, with shades of George Orwell, Sheila Heti has arrived on Canada&#39;s literary scene a fully formed artist. Balancing wisdom and innocence, joy and foreboding, each story in The Middle Stories leads us to surprising places. A frog doles out sage advice to a plumber infatuated with a princess, a boy falls hopelessly in love with a monkey, and a man with a hat keeps apocalyptic thoughts at bay by resolving to follow a plan that he admits he won&#39;t stick to.

Experts are attacked as partisan, statistics and scientific findings are decried as propaganda, and public debate devolves into personal assaults. How did we get here, and what can we do about it?</strong></p><p>In this sweeping and provocative work, political economist William Davies draws on a four-hundred-year history of ideas to reframe our understanding of the contemporary world. He argues that global trends decades and even centuries in the making have reduced a world of logic and fact into one driven by emotions&#x2015;particularly fear and anxiety. This has ushered in an age of &#x201c;nervous states,&#x201d; both in our individual bodies and our body politic.</p><p>Eloquently tracing the history of accounting, statistics, science, and human anatomy from the Enlightenment to the present, Davies shows how we invented expertise in the seventeenth century to calm the violent disputes&#x2015;over God and the nature of reality&#x2015;that ravaged Europe. By separating truth from emotion, scientific, testable facts paved a way out of constant warfare and established a basis for consensus, which became the bedrock of modern politics, business, and democracy.</p><p>Informed by research on psychology and economics, Davies reveals how widespread feelings of fear, vulnerability, physical and psychological pain, and growing inequality reshaped our politics, upending these centuries-old ideals of how we understand the world and organize society. Yet Davies suggests that the rise of emotion may open new possibilities for confronting humanity&#x2019;s greatest challenges. Ambitious and compelling, <em>Nervous States</em> is a perceptive and enduring account of our turbulent times.</p></p><p>William Davies is a political economist at Goldsmiths, University of London, the author of Nervous States and The Happiness Industry, among other books, and a contributor to publications including the Atlantic and the New York Times.

When nearly 40 she published the story collection <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, under the pseudonym George Eliot, partly because she was living with a married man, radical publisher George Henry Lewes, and feared being shunned by the public. Bu tin 1849 her fist novel <i>Adam Bede</i>, with its startling realism and psychologically astute characterizations, caused a sensation&#x2014;and prompted an imposter to claim authorship.

This drove the folk-song movement, just as Pete Seeger and the Weavers were putting "On Top of Old Smokey" and "Goodnight, Irene" on the Hit Parade, into a children's underground of schools, summer camps, and colleges, planting the seeds of the folk revival to come. The book is not so much a history as a study of the cultural process itself, what the author calls the dreamwork of history. <p></p><p> Cantwell shows how a body of music once enlisted on behalf of the labor movement, antifascism, New Deal recovery efforts, and many other progressive causes of the 1930s was refashioned as an instrument of self-discovery, even as it found a new politics and cultural style in the peace, civil rights, and beat movements. In Washington Square and the Newport Folk Festival, on college campuses and in concert halls across the country, the folk revival gave voice to the generational tidal wave of postwar youth, going back to the basics and trying to be very, very good. </p><p> In this capacious analysis of the ideologies, traditions, and personalities that created an extraordinary moment in American popular culture, Cantwell explores the idea of folk at the deepest level. Taking up some of the more obdurate problems in cultural studies--racial identity, art and politics, regional allegiances, class differences--he shows how the folk revival was a search for authentic democracy, with compelling lessons for our own time.</p></p><p><b>Robert S. Cantwell</b> is Adjunct Professor of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is the author of <i>Ethnomimesis: Folklife and the Representation of Culture</i> and the classic <i>Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound</i>.In his rich and suggestive, quirky and lyrical...study of the folk revival of the late 1950s and early 60s, Robert Cantwell...shows that the history of 20th-century folk music has depended on most unlikely associations. He argues persuasively that folk music's ability to move people, even to change their lives, comes from the fact that it has already crossed some of the deepest divides in American culture--race, class and region--and he invites listeners to do the same. The real strength of <i>When We Were Good</i> lies in the energy with which Mr. Cantwell, the author of two previous books on folk music and folk culture, pursues and celebrates this music's roots...Mr. Cantwell's book demonstrates beautifully that the convenient academic categories we use to slice up American history and culture are inadequate to grasp a cultural phenomenon like folk music...This is a rich and rewarding book, driven by evident passion...In this age of proliferating academic specialization and popular pride in one's 'roots,' Mr. Cantwell shows us that American popular music--and by extension much of our culture--is a hopelessly hybrid creation, descended from accidental couplings, political conflicts and ironies, blacks and whites. No wonder it has a haunting melody. (Warren Goldstein <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>The most detailed history of [the American folk music] revival yet undertaken...As Robert Chantwell charts brilliantly in <i>When We Were Good</i>, the process by which folk music (however defined) came to enjoy its brief moment of ascendancy in the late 1950s and early 1960s was more circuitous and complex than most knew or for that matter cared to know. (Geoffrey O'Brien <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br><i>When We Were Good</i> is a long-overdue account of an all too frequently ignored period of American popular music, roughly the seven years between the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and Bob Dylan's electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk festival. (<i>Record Collector (England)</i>)<br><br>Robert Cantwell's amazing book analyzes the cultural forces that culminated in that moment at Newport, when [Bob Dylan and Joan Baez] sang with Peter, Paul and Mary; Pete Seeger; and the SNCC Freedom Singers. But his book goes much deeper into American culture, probing the different ways people have tried to find an authentic American voice, distinct from high culture and uncontaminated by the seemingly irresistible forces of the entertainment industry...If the sixties folk song revival seems a mild, middle-class enthusiasm for the songs of the downtrodden, Cantwell shows it inquiring more deeply into the nature of American democracy itself. (Jon Wiener <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br>[A] detailed and well constructed history of the U.S. folksong revival of the fifties and sixties...Cantwell carefully shows how this folk revival, involving mostly people born in the 1930s and 1940s, began in a state of total commercialization, with the Kingston Trio and other slick pretenders with crew-cuts, and grew increasingly more authentic, and more creative, as the public gained in discrimination. (Douglas Fetherling <i>Telegraph Journal</i>)<br><br>[Cantwell] rewrites history with music, and vice versa. Diffusing a perfectly sketched generic, white, middle-class, suburban, postwar upbringing across the whole spectrum of American legend and experience, Cantwell pours old wine into a cruet that suddenly gleams with transparency...As he begins to trace the roles played by his characters--those figures dancing on the surface of 'Tom Dooley,' or hiding in its grooves--he makes the wine new. (Greil Marcus <i>Artforum</i>)<br><br>[Cantwell] effectively traces the theatrical, literary, musical and political origins of that folk revival, from the minstrels of the 19th century to the politically engaged folk-song movement of the Depression. The book springs vividly to life when discussing John Lomax and his son Alan, Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and above all, Pete Seeger. (Robert C. Cottrell <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>Cantwell's account of that...era combines the personal perspective of an informed participant with theory-laden explanations...[He] writes with a deep love and passion for his subject, and this book creates an engaging and often poetic picture of a folk revival that very few people know about. It is the movement that took place outside the limelight, growing underground through the McCarthy era, blossoming when the Kingston Trio's version of 'Tom Dooley' his the charts in 1957, and ending--not beginning--when Bob Dylan and Joan Baez appeared like Adam and Eve on the stage of the Newport Folk Festival together in 1963...Cantwell's portraits of early folk heroes are especially memorable...There is a generosity of spirit running through the book, directed toward those who made the music, those who revived it for their own ends, and us, his readers...<i>When We Were Good</i> offers a perspective on the folk revival that could not be more relevant and timely. (Hugh Blumenfeld <i>Boston Book Review</i>)</p><h2>Beethoven and His Nephew: A Psychoanalytical Study of Their Relationship</h2><p>Based largely on letters, documents, and other source material, the Sterbas&#39; book reveals a side of Beethoven&#39;s nature that was hinted at, but never made explicit, in previous biographies. Many readers may be shocked by the authors&#39; theory about the uncle-nephew relationship (maternal-filial rather than homosexual), but even those who cannot go along with their conclusions must admit that they have produced a well-written, fascinating and, in many ways, wholly believable case study which helps to explain many of the inconsistencies in Beethoven&#39;s character and in no way detracts from his unparalleled musical achievement. ~~Library Journal</p><p></p><h2>Henry&#39;s Sisters</h2><p>Ever since the Bommarito sisters were little girls, their mother, River, has written them a letter on pink paper when she has something especially important to impart. And this time, the message is urgent and impossible to ignore--River requires open-heart surgery, and Isabelle and her sisters are needed at home to run the family bakery and take care of their brother and ailing grandmother. <br><br>Isabelle has worked hard to leave Trillium River, Oregon, behind as she travels the globe taking award-winning photographs. It's not that Isabelle hates her family. On the contrary, she and her sisters Cecilia, an outspoken kindergarten teacher, and Janie, a bestselling author, share a deep, loving bond. And all of them adore their brother, Henry, whose disabilities haven't stopped him from helping out at the bakery and bringing good cheer to everyone in town. <br><br>But going home again has a way of forcing open the secrets and hurts that the Bommaritos would rather keep tightly closed. Working together to look after Henry and save their flagging bakery, Isabelle and her sisters begin to find answers to questions they never knew existed, unexpected ways to salve the wounds of their childhoods, and the courage to grasp surprising new chances at happiness. . .</p><p><b>Cathy Lamb</b> is the bestselling author of twelve novels, including&nbsp;<i>The Man She&nbsp;Married, No Place I&#x2019;d Rather Be, What I Remember Most, The Last Time I Was Me, Henry&#x2019;s Sisters</i>&nbsp;and <i>Julia&#x2019;s Chocolates</i>. She lives with her family in&nbsp;Oregon and can be found online at&nbsp;cathylamb.org.When the Bommarito sisters, Isabelle and Janie, hear that their domineering mother is going in for open heart surgery, they must forget the trauma of their childhood and return to their riverside Oregon hometown, Trillium River. Taking care of their mother and their demented grandmother (who believes she's Amelia Earhart) and watching after their mentally handicapped brother, Henry (possessed of an almost saintly, unconditional love for people), the independent sisters try to find a place in the world they've left behind. Lamb (The Last Time I Was Me) delivers grace, humor and forgiveness along with a litany of family trauma, which might seem heavy-handed in lesser hands. Fortunately, this finely pitched family melodrama is balanced with enough gallows humor and idiosyncratic characters to make it positively irresistible.

The conversations around me in the crowded lobby had become amplified and muffled, like I was floating in a diving bell surrounded by a lot of classy-looking fish. Fine. Just so long as I didn&#x2019;t have to talk to any of them. Any moment now, the lights were going to blink, and then we&#x2019;d have to take our seats, and I&#x2019;d be saved. Except, no, I&#x2019;d still be screwed. Because there wasn&#x2019;t a drug in the world that would make sitting through the show tonight anything but unremitting torture.<br> <br>We were already thirty minutes behind schedule. They were holding the curtain because everyone was having such a fine time gabbing with each other. So I had to come up with a plan because hiding would be pathetic, but people were going to try to talk to me, or worse&#x2014;congratulate me. It was opening night. And I was the cowriter. Giant letters spelled out my name on that building-sized sign out front. So congratulating me would seem like the thing to do. But this show was a special case, and I was a special case in this special case, and so collecting &#x201c;congratulations&#x201d; was like collecting a pile of wet socks.<br> <br>Of course, I imagined it was a hundred times worse for her. And, oh man, how the two of us yattered so eagerly about this night once upon a time. To think there was a time when&#x2014;no, I couldn&#x2019;t think about any of that&#x2014;I just had to walk purposefully and no one would stop me to talk. So I sidled past Bill Clinton and Lou Reed, Salman Rushdie, John McEnroe&#x2014;it was like being trapped in an updated version of the Sgt. Pepper album cover. I figured I&#x2019;d be fine so long as I didn&#x2019;t run into her, because I wouldn&#x2019;t know what to say. But I ran into someone else, and he immediately walked away which, like a sliding set piece, revealed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. her. And I didn&#x2019;t know what to say.<br> <br>Julie Taymor. She was standing near the doors that led out to Forty-third Street. She wasn&#x2019;t going to come at all tonight, which was boggling. Yet understandable. And, in being understandable, even more boggling. It had been three months since I&#x2019;d last seen her, and the rush of old, cozy feelings smacked against The New Reality, and the impact made me just sick.<br> <br>Even now, I carry the dream with me every day&#x2014;to make up with her. So it all can be as sunny as it once was. Publishing a book detailing our six years together might not be the most effective way to achieve that. In fact, I was warned not to write about any of this. But I can&#x2019;t help it&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a story, and that&#x2019;s what we do with stories. We tell them. In fact, this whole book is a story about storytelling&#x2014;the story of an epic attempt by earnest human beings to tell a story and to tell that story brilliantly. Only, there&#x2019;s this:<br> <br>Before something can be brilliant, it first has to be competent.<br> <br>&#x2014;from My List of Lessons Learned<br> <br>One should probably begin the story of the making and remaking of a Broadway musical about Spider-Man with that hallowed day in 1962 when Stan Lee, along with illustrator Steve Ditko, came up with The Big Idea: Bullied high schooler acquires spider powers.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a trim little setup. And just different enough to be revolutionary. Not only was this teenaged Peter Parker suddenly burdened with &#x201c;great responsibilities,&#x201d; he still had to run the every-day gauntlet every teenager has to run&#x2014;the social troubles, the money troubles, the dermatological troubles&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>A comic-book panel would depict a publisher sitting behind a cluttered desk in the cramped Madison Avenue offices of Marvel Comics staring at a sketch of a figure wearing a bodysuit covered in webbing. Lee and Ditko would be standing on the other side of the desk, looking on expectantly. The publisher would be looking&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. doubtful.<br> <br>&#x201c;Several months later&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; would read the caption in our next panel. Lee and Ditko&#x2019;s new superhero is swinging with a hoodlum under his arm on the cover of Marvel&#x2019;s Amazing Fantasy #15. It&#x2019;s our webslinger&#x2019;s debut, and it&#x2019;s in the final issue of an anthology series already slotted to be canceled. That&#x2019;s how dubious the publisher was of this new &#x201c;spider-man&#x201d; idea.<br> <br>The next comic-book panel would flash us forward forty years. It would be a split screen depicting the gleaming offices of media giant Marvel Entertainment on one side and the makeshift office of two almost-entirely-untested Broadway producers on the other. The producers are being informed via phone that they&#x2019;ve just been granted the rights to make a musical out of Marvel&#x2019;s most treasured property: Spider-Man. Exclamation points shine above the producers&#x2019; heads.<br> <br>But if this is a story about storytelling cast through the prism of Spider-Man the Musical, then maybe we should be starting fifty-thousand years ago, back in a time when the world was teeming with Paleolithic ceremonies featuring singing, dancing, and human characters endowed with animal powers. In a large, single-paneled splash page, we would see two prehistoric figures arguing over just how their musical performance is supposed to go. On their hairy faces&#x2014;anger, exasperation. Why? Because collaboration, by definition, requires humans to interact with each other. Which means every moment in a collaboration quivers with the potential for transcendental connection. And also fury, and hair-tearing frustration, and silences as icy as distant planets. Just look at Lee and Ditko. You think they had a falling-out?

We do it as automatically as a pancreas produces insulin. We&#x2019;re compelled to codify otherwise-random events into cause and effect. Into patterns. Into narrative. It&#x2019;s a drive that in part makes humans so human. And it&#x2019;s a hunger that drove the creators of this confounded musical (as well as its audiences) into spasms of excitement, disappointment, and a few dozen other emotions as the show careened down the long road to its much-delayed opening night.<br> <br>And it&#x2019;s why my last comic-book panel would depict a scene from opening night. I would draw it in an emo-manga style, with a smudged, cocktail-sipping crowd in the background. In the foreground, a woman with flowing hair framing sad-smiling eyes is regarding the addled-looking man in front of her. The man&#x2019;s heart is on his sleeve, his tongue is in a knot, and in the banner at the top of the panel, that poor schmuck&#x2019;s thoughts from over a year later are revealed:<br> <br>I loved her. I still do.<br> <br>With heart-scarred bewilderment,<br> <br>I love her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>And the thing of it is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she despises me.<br> <br>Julie Taymor despises me with photograph-shredding rage.

But I doubt it. While I was writing this book, teams of lawyers were busy submitting suits and countersuits. Among other demands, Julie wanted half of my money. And I wasn&#x2019;t about to give it to her.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s what happened.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>Or&#x2014;wait&#x2014;let me say one more thing first.<br> <br>I am aware&#x2014;I really am&#x2014;that the following pages contain metaphors more appropriate for an account of an amputation tent in the Crimean War; adjectives best saved for the Apollo space program or the Bataan Death March.

Witty and poignant, its pages melt away like an unsettling yet familiar dream.&#39; Sunday Times ----------- &#39;Deborah Levy has made something strange and new ... spiky and unsettling. In this novel, home is elusive, safety is unlikely, and the reader closes the book both satisfied and unnerved.&#39; The Guardian ----------- &#39;A stealthily devastating book ... Levy manipulates light and shadow with artfulness. She transfixes the reader: we recognize the thing of darkness in us all. This is an intelligent, pulsating literary beast.&#39; The Telegraph ----------- &#39;Swimming Home is a beautiful, delicate book underpinned by a complexity that only reveals itself slowly to the reader.&#39; Financial Times ----------- &#39;This amazing novel is a haunting exploration of loss and longing.

But how could Louisa May Alcott-who never had a romance-write so convincingly of love and heart-break without experiencing it herself? <br><br> Deftly mixing fact and fiction, Kelly O'Connor McNees imagines a love affair that would threaten Louisa's writing career-and inspire the story of Jo and Laurie in <i>Little Women</i>. Stuck in small-town New Hampshire in 1855, Louisa finds herself torn between a love that takes her by surprise and her dream of independence as a writer in Boston. The choice she must make comes with a steep price that she will pay for the rest of her life.</p><p><b>Kelly O'Connor McNees</b> is a former editorial assistant and English teacher. Originally from Michigan, she now resides with her husband in Chicago.Louisa May Alcott&#39;s fans have long speculated that the romance between Jo and Laurie in LITTLE WOMEN might have been based on some unknown aspect of Alcott&#39;s real-life experience. Here the author weaves a fictional story out of that speculation. Emily Card&#39;s authentic performance is akin to eavesdropping on Alcott&#39;s private journal entries, which are blended with the fictional aspects of the story. Card&#39;s voice captures Louisa&#39;s passion for writing and her independent spirit, which, in her mind, means foregoing marriage with her fictional lover, Joseph Singer. In the novel their romance is intricately linked to Walt Whitman&#39;s LEAVES OF GRASS, poems that favor their liberal views. Card shifts smoothly from the familiar voices of Louisa&#39;s family to her father&#39;s Transcendentalist theories, which mire the family in poverty. The combination of Alcott&#39;s words and Card&#39;s reading is magic. K.P.

Stiff joints, sore backs, and fatigue can be reversed by regular aerobic, stretching, and muscle-building exercises. These two books offer sensible programs to increase fitness and vitality in almost everyone aged 50 to 80. Pretend Your Nose Is a Crayon , written by a physical therapist, offers a gentle, humorous, "user friendly" approach to fitness. It presents basic principles of physiology to introduce the ten-minute-a-day, three-times-a-week routine that utilizes strength-building weights. Exercises are illustrated with photos of "models" ranging in age from the early 50s to 94. Other chapters detail special exercises for those with arthritis, chronic back problems, or other injuries, along with tips for starting a walking program and incorporating exercises into household and garden chores. " Biomarkers," developed by two Tufts University researchers, are ten indicators of physical function that influence well-being. These indicators, including muscle mass, strength, blood pressure, and aerobic capacity can be controlled by almost anyone of any age through regular aerobic and isotonic exercise. This book discusses each biomarker in detail, with references to recent scientific literature, and provides two self-tests to determine fitness levels. Programs, presented as charts illustrated with drawings, are geared for a variety of fitness levels. Tips on diet and motivation accompany the charts. Exercises aren't that much different from those in Greenberg's book, but may appear a bit daunting for the over-50 group who may never before have participated in a regular exercise or fitness program.<br><i>- Karen McNally Bensing, Benjamin Rose Inst.

His brother, Christian, joined him a decade later. By 1875 their firm, renamed Herter Brothers, was supplying the White House with furnishings, as it had been doing for some of America&#39;s wealthiest families since 1858. During this opulent period, Herter Brothers could claim to be the leading cabinetmaking and decorating firm in the country. The Herter brothers&#39; extraordinary accomplishment has never before been the subject of a book. Here, at last, is an in-depth study of these talented men, their company, and its work, prized then as now for its design, richness of materials and detail, superb craftsmanship, and splendid diversity. The best of the Herter Brothers&#39; furniture and interiors are displayed in 133 color and 167 black-and-white illustrations, including many close-up details as well as comparative work by rival fine cabinetmakers of the time in New York and Europe. Herter Brothers tells the story of the company from its earliest manifestations, when Gustave worked with other partners and alone, through his partnership with his brother, to Christian&#39;s years as head of the firm and the end of his tenure. The book places the company firmly in its context, international as well as domestic, with an extensive discussion of the brothers&#39; background and influences and an absorbing narrative of the furniture and decoration trade in New York City in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Also described is the superb work done by the firm for their fabulously wealthy patrons - a who&#39;s who of the Gilded Age, including J. Pierpont Morgan, William H. Vanderbilt, and Jay Gould - for whom the Herters created some of their most lavish furniture and complete interiors. These commissions, many illustrated here, included woodwork, plasterwork, lighting fixtures, window treatments, wall and ceiling paintings, carpets, textiles.</p><p>Gustave Herter fled to America in 1848, followed by his brother, Christian, in 1859. By 1875 the furniture from the "Herter Brothers" shop was in great demand by America's wealthiest families, who were decorating in the opulent style that would give the era the name "Gilded Age." This first in-depth study of the unique style and creations of the Herters, who worked with exotic woods and ornate inlay combined with ebonizing and gilding, is published in conjunction with an exhibit that will tour Houston, Atlanta, and New York. Lavishly illustrated with 167 black-and-white photos of historic interiors and 133 color plates, including many close-ups of their detailed work, this volume clearly shows why the Herters were wooed for their furnishings by J.P. Morgan, Jay Gould, Theodore Roosevelt, and all the Vanderbilts. Fine supplementary reading for those who enjoyed the Wharton novel and Scorsese film The Age of Innocence; highly recommended.<br><i>Joseph Hewgley, Nash-ville P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Experts in the field of decorative arts contribute historically detailed essays to this fine book, serving as a catalogue for a recent exhibition that pays a long overdue tribute to the lavishly crafted furniture and art objects of Christian and Gustave Herter. If the Herter brothers' name is not as well known as such contemporary designers as William Morris, this book will be a fitting introduction to the exquisite work they produced. Many of the gilded, ornately carved, and marquetry-embellished cabinets, chairs, and tables pictured here adorned residences of prosperous patrons--J. P. Morgan, William Vanderbilt, and the White House, among others. In numerous color photographs and vintage images depicting entire interiors designed by their firm, this beautiful study gives duly merited attention to the Herter brothers' legacy. <i>Alice Joyce</i></p><h2>British Admirals of the Fleet 1734 - 1995: A Biographical Dictionary</h2><p>A companion volume to the same author&#39;s &#34;The British Field Marshals 1736-1997&#34;, this book outlines the lives of the 115 officers who held the rank of Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy from 1734, when it took its modern form, to 1995, when the last one was appointed. Each entry gives details of the dates of the birth and death of its subjects, their careers ashore and afloat, their family backgrounds, and the ships, campaigns and combats in which they served. Each is placed clearly in its domestic or international political context. The actions recorded include major fleet battles under sail or steam, single-ship duels, encounters with pirates on the Spanish Main and up the rivers of Borneo, the suppression of the Slave Trade (for which the Navy receives little gratitude), landing parties to deal with local dictators and revolutionaries, and the services of naval brigades in China, Egypt and South Africa.</p><p>Tony Heathcote was the Librarian at the RMAS Sandhurst until his retirement.

Amazon.com says "Layla stands as one of a handful of pillars of classic rock." Eric Clapton's rendition of the title song packs such a raw emotional wallop that Dave Marsh wrote in the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll: "There are few moments in the repertoire of recorded rock where a singer or writer has reached so deeply into himself that the effect of hearing him is akin to witnessing a murder, or a suicide . . . To me, Layla is the greatest of them."<br><br>The music may be timeless, but the lives of the tortured souls who produced this great album clearly were not; most were cut short by accident or substance abuse, while those who remain bear deep scars. And lead player Eric Clapton, despite a hugely successful career, has been shadowed by this album, which he knew at the time would be the defining high point of his career. Both casual and committed rock fans will be compelled by the heartbreaking and often lurid details surrounding the saga of Layla and Derek and the Dominos&#x2014;which has never been completely disclosed until now.</p><p>JAN REID is the author or coauthor of eight books, including The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock and The Bullet Meant for Me. He is a founding contributor and writer-at-large for Texas Monthly and has also written for Esquire, the New York Times, GQ, and Men&#39;s Journal. He lives in Austin, Texas.Thank god for Bobby Whitlock. The keyboard player, second lead singer, and song coauthor of the short-lived, fondly remembered Derek and the Dominos comes from a long line of, as he says, "river rats, whores, and moonshiners," and as Reid's principal informant for this jolly rock-album history, he's a gold mine. He was raffish to the max, and his band mates weren't stiffs, either. Drummer Jim Gordon was already on the road to homicidal dementia, bassist Carl Radle was gigging with all the rising stars of southern rock, of whom guitarist Duane Allman was indisputably the biggest and brightest. And then there was the group's raison d'etre, archetypal rock guitar god Eric Clapton, sodden in love with best friend George Harrison's wife but at the top of his game on his ax. There isn't all that much about actually making the great record here, but the horror show of substance abuse and poor impulse control that Reid shows began, for most of the band's members, before they were born, is appallingly amusing. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Originally delivered as the 2001 Slade Lectures in the Fine Arts at Oxford University, the book makes its deeply complex argument remarkably accessible and powerfully clear. Concentrating on a period from the beginning of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, Donald Preziosi presents case studies of major institutions that, he argues, have defined--and are still defining--the possible limits of museological and art historical theory and practice. These include Sir John Soane&#39;s Museum in London, preserved in its 1837 state; the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851; and four museums founded by Europeans in Egypt in the late nineteenth century, which divided up that country&#39;s history into &#34;ethnically marked&#34; aesthetic hierarchies and genealogies that accorded with Europe&#39;s construction of itself as the present of the world&#39;s past, and the &#34;brain of the earth&#39;s body.&#34; Through this epistemological and institutional archaeology, Preziosi unearths the outlines of the more radical Enlightenment project that academic art history, professional museology, and art criticism have rendered marginal or invisible. Finally, he sketches a new theory about art, artifice, and visual signification in the cracks and around the margins of the &#34;secular theologisms&#34; of the globalized imperial capital called modernity. Addressed equally to the theoretical and philosophical foundations of art history,museology, history, and anthropology, this book goes to the heart of recent debates about race, ethnicity, nationality, colonialism, and multiculturalisms--and to the very foundations of modernity and modern modes of knowledge production.</p><p>Donald Preziosi is Professor of Art History at UCLA, where he developed and directs the art history critical theory program, as well as the UCLA museum studies program.<br>Louise Hitchcock is a Research Associate of the Institute of Archaeology at UCLA.

Her 2009 Australia Open championship earned her the #1 world ranking for the third time in her illustrious career - and marked only the latest exclamation point on a life well and purposefully lived. As a young girl, Serena began training with an adult-sized racquet that was almost as big as her. Rather than dropping the racquet, Serena saw it as a challenge to overcome-and she has confronted every obstacle on her path to success with the same unflagging spirit. From growing up in the tough, hardscrabble neighborhood of Compton, California, to being trained by her father on public tennis courts littered with broken glass and drug paraphernalia, to becoming the top women&#39;s player in the world, Serena has proven to be an inspiration to her legions of fans both young and old. Her accomplishments have not been without struggle: being derailed by injury, devastated by the tragic shooting of her older sister, and criticized for her unorthodox approach to tennis. Yet somehow, Serena always manages to prevail. Both on the court and off, she&#39;s applied the strength and determination that helped her to become a champion to successful pursuits in philanthropy, fashion, television and film. In this compelling and poignant memoir, Serena takes an empowering look at her extraordinary life and what is still to come.</p><p><strong>Serena Williams</strong> is one of the top athletes in tennis and in all of sports. At the age of 27, she has captured every major title. Growing up in Compton, CA, she was trained by her father on the public tennis courts before rising up the tennis ranks. Serena has wide-ranging interests aside from tennis, including starting her own fashion line and opening a school for children in Africa.<br><br><strong>Daniel Paisner</strong> is the author or co-author of more than forty books. He has collaborated on seven <em>New York Times</em> best-selling titles, including Denzel Washington's <em>A Hand to Guide Me</em>, Whoopi Goldberg's <em>Book</em> and Geraldo Rivera's <em>Exposing Myself. </em>He lives in Port Washington, NY.In this able mid-career autobiography, tennis sensation Williams chronicles a childhood spent living the game with her four sisters and determined parents, and the success that followed. Faith, work ethic, and a love of tennis were paramount to the Williams children's upbringing, qualities that saw her through title contests from coast to coast, and then worldwide. Along the way, she's established schools in third world countries and visited "slave castles" on the African coast; she also persevered through the fatal shooting of her oldest sister in 2003. Waylaid briefly, Williams came back stronger than ever, a testament to her determination, sheer guts and game sense of humor. Philosophical nuggets are scattered throughout: "You might think you're in control, but you're never really in control"; "It can be very isolating, very lonely, competing at a high level in an individual sport"; and "Remember, there are so many more important things. This is so small." Besides recapping important matches, Williams also looks at her sponsorships, sportswear line, and romances, but returns again and again to the unbreakable Williams family ties, especially between Serena and her equally successful sister Venus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The locomotive needs a track, the marine engine a hull and a stretch of water, but a traction engine can run on any area of reasonable ground. Coupled with the enormous growth of interest in preserving and running full-sized engines at agricultural shows and steam rallies, it is no wonder that traction engine models are so popular. In this book, John Haining, the doyen of traction engine modelling, explains what is involved in the construction of working steam models and outlines briefly the history and variety of such engines. A degree of reader familiarity with normal machine work and workshop practice is assumed, but even the inexperienced lathe owner will easily follow the procedures with the aid of the many clear illustrations provided by the author and will be encouraged to try his hand at this fascinating branch of model engineering.</p><p>John Haining gave up the family farm to serve an apprenticeship in steam when it was still the predominant source of power in the countryside. An apprentice&#39;s life was a hard one in those days but the hard work and strict training stood him in good stead and led on to further valuable experience gained in the drawing and design offices of Cammell Laird, Joseph the boilermakers of Hyde, and Sentinels of Shrewsbury. He died in 2005.</p><h2>Other Kingdoms</h2><p><br><br>For over half a century, Richard Matheson has enthralled and terrified readers with such timeless classics as <i>I Am Legend</i>, <i>The Incredible Shrinking Man</i>, <i>Duel</i>, <i>Somewhere in Time</i>, and <i>What Dreams May Come</i>.

As banks collapsed and the state scrambled to organize one of the largest transfers of wealth in history, many&#x2014;including economists and financial experts&#x2014;were shocked by the speed at which events unfolded.</p><p>In this new book, John Bellamy Foster and Fred Magdoff offer a bold analysis of the financial meltdown, how it developed, and the implications for the future. They examine the specifics of the housing bubble and the credit crunch as well as situate current events within a broader crisis of monopoly-finance capitalism&#x2014;one that has been gestating for several decades. It is the "real" productive economy&#x2019;s tendency toward stagnation, they argue, that creates a need for capital to find ways to profitably invest its surplus. But rather than invest in socially useful projects that would benefit the vast majority, capital has constructed a financialized "casino" economy that neglects social needs and, as has become increasingly clear, is fatally unstable. Written over a two-year period immediately prior to the onset of the crisis, this timely and illuminating book is necessary reading for all those who wish to understand the current situation, how we got here, and where we are heading.</p></p><p><p><b>John Bellamy Foster</b> is editor of <i>Monthly Review</i>. He is professor of sociology at the University of Oregon and author of <i>The Ecological Revolution</i>, <i>The Great Financial Crisis</i> (with Fred Magdoff), <i>Critique of Intelligent Design</i> (with Brett Clark and Richard York), <i>Ecology Against Capitalism</i>, <i>Marx&#x2019;s Ecology</i>, and <i>The Vulnerable Planet</i>.</p>In this timely and thorough analysis of the current financial crisis, Foster and Magdoff explore its roots and the radical changes that might be undertaken in response. With a foray into the Great Depression of the 1930s, they move to the present situation, born out of the housing bubble, the wider explosion of debt and the problem of financialization of capital. They survey the long-term implications and the larger political-economic aspects of the crisis to propose that the crisis raises questions that are primarily political rather than economic. They suggest that society will eventually conclude that our fatally unstable political-economic structure should be replaced with one of social use rather than private gain&#x2014;a more humane order geared to collective needs. This book makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing examination of our current debt crisis, one that deserves our full attention. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Serena Butler&#x2019;s Jihad may be over, but now we must continue the fight against a more insidious and challenging enemy&#x2014;human weakness for technology and the temptation to repeat the mistakes of the past.</i><br>&#x2014;MANFORD TORONDO, <i>The Only Path</i><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Manford Torondo had lost count of his many missions. Some he wanted to forget, like the horrific day that the explosion tore him apart and cost him the lower half of his body. This mission, though, would be easier, and eminently satisfying&#x2014;eradicating more remnants of mankind&#x2019;s greatest enemy.<br>Bristling with cold weapons, the machine warships hung outside the solar system, where only the faintest mist of dwindled starlight glinted off their hulls. As a result of the annihilation of the scattered Omnius everminds, this robot attack group had never reached its destination, and the population of the nearby League star system never even realized they had been a target. Now Manford&#x2019;s scouts had found the fleet again.<br>Those dangerous enemy vessels, still intact, armed, and functional, hung dead in space, long after the Battle of Corrin. Mere derelicts, ghost ships&#x2014;but abominations, nonetheless. They had to be dealt with accordingly.<br>As his six small vessels approached the mechanical monstrosities, Manford experienced a primal shudder. The dedicated followers of his Butlerian movement were sworn to destroy all vestiges of forbidden computer technology. Now, without hesitation, they closed in on the derelict robot fleet, like gulls on the carcass of a beached whale.<br>The voice of Swordmaster Ellus crackled over the comm from an adjacent ship. For this operation, the Swordmaster flew point, guiding the Butlerian hunters to these insidious robot vessels that had drifted unnoticed for decades. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an attack squadron of twenty-five ships, Manford&#x2014;exactly where the Mentat predicted we&#x2019;d find them.&#x201d;<br>Propped in a seat that had been specially modified to accommodate his legless body, Manford nodded to himself. Gilbertus Albans continued to impress him with his mental prowess. &#x201c;Once again, his Mentat School proves that human brains are superior to thinking machines.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The mind of man is holy,&#x201d; Ellus said.<br>&#x201c;The mind of man is holy.&#x201d; It was a benediction that had come to Manford in a vision from God, and the saying was very popular now with the Butlerians. Manford signed off and continued to watch the unfolding operation from his own compact ship.<br>Seated next to him in the cockpit, Swordmaster Anari Idaho noted the position of the robot battleships on the screen and announced her assessment. She wore a black-and-gray uniform with the emblem of the movement on her lapel, a stylized sigil that featured a blood-red fist clenching a symbolic machine gear.<br>&#x201c;We have enough weaponry to destroy them from a distance,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if we use the explosives wisely. No need to risk boarding the ships. They&#x2019;ll be guarded by combat meks and linked fighting drones.&#x201d;<br>Looking up at his female attendant and friend, Manford maintained a stony demeanor, though she always warmed his heart. &#x201c;There is no risk&#x2014;the evermind is dead. And I want to gaze at these machine demons before we eliminate them.&#x201d;<br>Dedicated to Manford&#x2019;s cause, and to him personally, Anari accepted the decision. &#x201c;As you wish. I will keep you safe.&#x201d; The look on her wide, innocent face convinced Manford that he could do no wrong in her eyes, make no mistakes&#x2014;and as a result of her devotion, Anari protected him with ferocity.<br>Manford issued brisk orders. &#x201c;Divide my followers into groups. No need to hurry&#x2014;I prefer perfection to haste. Have Swordmaster Ellus coordinate the scuttling charges across the machine ships. Not a scrap can remain once we&#x2019;re finished.&#x201d;<br>Because of his physical limitations, watching the destruction was one of the few things that gave him pleasure. Thinking machines had overrun his ancestral planet of Moroko, captured the populace, and unleashed their plagues, murdering everyone. If his great-great-grandparents had not been away from home, conducting business on Salusa Secundus, they would have been trapped as well, and killed. And Manford would never have been born.<br>Though the events affecting his ancestors had occurred generations ago, he still hated the machines, and vowed to continue the mission.<br>Accompanying the Butlerian followers were five trained Swordmasters, the Paladins of Humanity, who had fought hand-to-hand against thinking machines during Serena Butler&#x2019;s Jihad. In the decades after the great victory on Corrin, Swordmasters had busied themselves with cleanup operations, tracking down and wrecking any remnants of the robotic empire they found scattered throughout the solar systems. Thanks to their success, such remnants were getting more and more difficult to locate.<br>As the Butlerian ships arrived among the machine vessels, Anari watched the images on her screen. In a soft voice, which she used only with him, she mused, &#x201c;How many more fleets like this do you think we&#x2019;ll find, Manford?&#x201d;<br>The answer was clear. &#x201c;I want all of them.&#x201d;<br>These dead robotic battle fleets were easy targets that served as symbolic victories, when properly filmed and broadcast. Lately, though, Manford had also become worried about the rot, corruption, and temptation he observed within the new Corrino Imperium. How could people forget the dangers so quickly? Soon enough, he might need to channel his followers&#x2019; fervor in a different direction and have them perform another necessary cleansing among the populations....<br>Swordmaster Ellus took care of the administrative details, sorting the robotic ships onto a grid and assigning teams to specific targets. The five other ships settled in among the derelict machines and attached to individual hulls. Then the respective teams blasted their way aboard.<br>Manford&#x2019;s team suited up and prepared to board the largest robotic vessel, and he insisted on going along to see the evil with his own eyes, despite the effort it entailed. He would never be content to stay behind and watch; he was accustomed to using Anari as his legs, as well as his sword. The sturdy leather harness was always close by in case Manford needed to go into battle. She pulled the harness onto her shoulders, adjusted the seat behind her neck, then attached the straps under her arms and across her chest and waist.<br>Anari was a tall and physically fit woman and, in addition to being faultlessly loyal to Manford, she also loved him&#x2014;he could see that every time he looked into her eyes. But <i>all</i> of his followers loved him; Anari&#x2019;s affection was just more innocent, and more pure than most.<br>She hefted his legless body easily, as she had done countless times before, and settled his torso onto the seat behind her head. He didn&#x2019;t feel like a child when he rode on her shoulders; he felt as if Anari were part of him. His legs had been blown off by a deluded technology-lover&#x2019;s bomb that had killed Rayna Butler, the saintly leader of the anti-machine movement. Manford had been blessed by Rayna herself, in the moments before she died of her injuries.<br>The Suk doctors called it a miracle that he&#x2019;d survived at all, and it was that: <i>a miracle.</i> He&#x2019;d been meant to live on after the horrifying day. Despite the physical loss, Manford had seized the helm of the Butlerian movement, and led them with great fervor. <i>Half a man, twice the leader.</i> He had a few fragments of pelvis left, but very little remained below his hips; nevertheless, he still had his mind and heart, and did not need anything else. Just his followers.<br>His curtailed body fit neatly into the socket of Anari&#x2019;s harness, and he rode high on her shoulders. With subtle shifts of his weight, he guided her like part of his own body, an extension below his waist. &#x201c;Take me to the hatch, so we can be the first to board.&#x201d;<br>Even so, he was at the mercy of her movements and decisions. &#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m sending the other three ahead.&#x201d; Anari meant no challenge in her refusal. &#x201c;Only after they verify there is no danger will I take you aboard. My mission to protect you outweighs your impatience. We go when I have been advised that it is safe, and not a moment sooner.&#x201d;<br>Manford ground his teeth together. He knew she meant well, but her overprotectiveness could be frustrating. &#x201c;I expect no one to take risks in my stead.&#x201d;<br>Anari looked up and over her shoulder to gaze at his face, with an endearing smile. &#x201c;Of course we take risks in your stead. We would all lay down our lives for you.&#x201d;<br>While Manford&#x2019;s team boarded the dead robotic ship, searching the metal corridors and looking for places to plant charges, he waited aboard his own vessel, fidgeting in his harness. &#x201c;What have they found?&#x201d;<br>She did not budge. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll report when they have something to report.&#x201d;<br>Finally, the team checked in. &#x201c;There are a dozen combat meks aboard, sir&#x2014;all of them cold and deactivated. Temperature is frigid, but we&#x2019;ve restarted the life-support systems so you can come aboard in comfort.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in comfort.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you need to breathe. They will tell us when they&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;<br>Though robots did not require life-support systems, many of the machine vessels had been equipped to haul human captives in the cargo bays. In the final years of the Jihad, Omnius had dedicated all functional vessels to the battle fleet, while also building huge automated shipyards to churn out new war vessels by the thousands.<br>And still the humans had won, sacrificing everything for the only victory that mattered....<br>Half an hour later, the atmosphere in the machine ship reached a level where Manford could survive without an environment suit. &#x201c;Ready for you to come aboard, sir. We&#x2019;ve located several good places to plant explosive charges. And human skeletons, sir. A cargo hold, at least fifty captives.&#x201d;<br>Manford perked up. &#x201c;Captives?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Long dead, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming.&#x201d; Satisfied, Anari descended to the connecting hatch, and he rode high on her back, feeling like a conquering king. Aboard the large vessel, the air was still razor-thin and cold. Manford shuddered, then grasped Anari&#x2019;s shoulders to steady himself.<br>She gave him a concerned glance. &#x201c;Should we have waited another fifteen minutes for the air to warm up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the cold, Anari&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the evil in the air. How can I forget all the human blood these monsters spilled?&#x201d;<br>Aboard the dim and austere ship, Anari took him to the chamber where the Butlerians had pried open the sealed door to reveal a jumble of human skeletons, dozens of people who had been left to starve or suffocate, likely because the thinking machines didn&#x2019;t care.<br>The Swordmaster wore a deeply troubled and hurt expression. For all her hardened fighting experience, Anari Idaho remained astonished by the offhand cruelty of the thinking machines. Manford both admired and loved her for her innocence. &#x201c;They must have been hauling captives,&#x201d; Anari said.<br>&#x201c;Or experimental subjects for the evil robot Erasmus,&#x201d; Manford said. &#x201c;When the ships received new orders to attack this system, they paid no further attention to the humans aboard.&#x201d; He muttered a silent prayer and blessing, hoping to speed the lost souls off to heaven.<br>As Anari led him away from the human-cargo chamber, they passed an angular, deactivated combat mek that stood like a statue in the corridor. The arms sported cutting blades and projectile weapons; its blunt head and optic threads were a mockery of a human face. Looking at the machine in disgust, Manford suppressed another shudder. <i>This must never be allowed to happen again.</i><br>Anari drew her long, blunt pulse-sword. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to blow up these ships anyway, sir&nbsp;... but would you indulge me?&#x201d;<br>He smiled. &#x201c;Without hesitation.&#x201d;<br>Like a released spring, the Swordmaster attacked the motionless robot; one blow obliterated the mek&#x2019;s optic threads, more blows severed the limbs, others smashed the body core. Deactivated for decades, the mek didn&#x2019;t even spurt a stream of sparks or lubricant fluid when she dismembered it.<br>Looking down, breathing heavily, she said, &#x201c;Back at the Swordmaster School on Ginaz, I slew hundreds of these things. The school still has a standing order for functional combat meks, so trainees can practice destroying them.&#x201d;<br>The very thought soured Manford&#x2019;s mood. &#x201c;Ginaz has too many functional meks, in my opinion&#x2014;it makes me uneasy. Thinking machines should not be kept as pets. There is no useful purpose for any sophisticated machine.&#x201d;<br>Anari was hurt that he had criticized her fond recollection. Her voice was small. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s how we learned to fight them, sir.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Humans should train against humans.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the same.&#x201d; Anari took out her frustration on the already battered combat mek. She bludgeoned it one last time, then stalked toward the bridge. They found several other meks along the way, and she dispatched each one, with all the ferocity that Manford felt in his heart.<br>On the robotic control deck, he and Anari met up with the other team members. The Butlerians had knocked over a pair of deactivated robots at the ship&#x2019;s controls. &#x201c;All the engines function, sir,&#x201d; one gangly man reported. &#x201c;We could add explosives to the fuel tanks just for good measure, or we can overload the reactors from here.&#x201d;<br>Manford nodded. &#x201c;The explosions need to be big enough to eradicate all the nearby ships. These vessels are still operational, but I don&#x2019;t want to use even the scrap metal. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;... contaminated.&#x201d;<br>He knew that others did not have such qualms. Beyond his control, groups of corruptible humans were scouring the space shipping lanes to find intact fleets like this for salvage and repair. Scavengers without principles! The VenHold Spacing Fleet was notorious for this; more than half of their ships were refurbished thinking-machine vessels. Manford had argued with Directeur Josef Venport several times over the issue, but the greedy businessman refused to see reason. Manford took some consolation in the knowledge that at least these twenty-five enemy warships would never be used.<br>Butlerians understood that technology was seductive, fraught with latent danger. Humanity had grown soft and lazy since the overthrow of Omnius. People tried to make exceptions, seeking convenience and comfort, pushing the boundaries to their perceived advantage. They wheedled and made excuses: <i>that</i> machine might be bad, but <i>this</i> slightly different technology was acceptable.<br>Manford refused to draw artificial lines. It was a slippery slope. One small thing could lead to another, and another, and soon the downgrade would become a cliff. The human race must never be enslaved by machines again!<br>Now he swiveled his head to address the three Butlerians on the bridge. &#x201c;Go. My Swordmaster and I have one last thing to do here. Send a message to Ellus&#x2014;we should be away within fifteen minutes.&#x201d;<br>Anari knew exactly what Manford had in mind; she had, in fact, prepared for it. As soon as the other followers returned to their ship, the Swordmaster removed a small gilded icon from a pouch in her harness, one of many such icons that Manford had commissioned. He held the icon reverently, looked at the benevolent face of Rayna Butler. For seventeen years now, he had followed in that visionary woman&#x2019;s footsteps.<br>Manford k...</p><h2>The Mystery of the Galloping Ghost (Trixie Belden)</h2><p>On a vacation trip to a Minnesota horse-breeding ranch Trixie investigates the connection between a stolen racehorse and the sighting of a phantom rider</p><p></p><h2>The Country Diaries: A Year in the British Countryside</h2><p><p>The unique beauty of the British countryside has been celebrated down the ages in music, poetry, and art.

Reprint.</p><p>Peter Bowen (b. 1945) is an author best known for mystery novels set in the modern American West. When he was ten, Bowen&#x2019;s family moved to Bozeman, Montana, where a paper route introduced him to the grizzled old cowboys who frequented a bar called The Oaks. Listening to their stories, some of which stretched back to the 1870s, Bowen found inspiration for his later fiction.&nbsp;Following time at the University of Michigan and the University of Montana, Bowen published his first novel, <i>Yellowstone Kelly</i>, in 1987. After two more novels featuring the real-life Western hero, Bowen published <i>Coyote Wind</i> (1994), which introduced Gabriel Du Pr�, a mixed-race lawman living in fictional Toussaint, Montana. Bowen has written fourteen novels in the series, in which Du Pr� gets tangled up in everything from cold-blooded murder to the hunt for rare fossils. Bowen continues to live and write in Livingston, Montana.<br>Bowen sustains interest in this follow-up to Coyote Wind despite the lack of a believable suspect, discernible clues or a precise sense of place. He relies on his unusual protagonist, Gabriel Du Pre, a laconic rancher, fiddle player and self-mocking, part Native American freethinker given to abstract utterances. Lured from his native Montana to perform in a Washington, D.C., music festival, Du Pre is fiddling when a young Indian woman dies, the first of several murders that occur in his trail. Each is committed with a primitive weapon; all are foretold by a shaman; in the vicinity, each time, is psychotic rich man and artistic hanger-on, Paul Chase. Yet all Du Pre can do is wait for the shaman's next warning and follow his best hunches: that the killer's motive is pleasure, that Chase is being used for cover and that Du Pre is the killer's real focus. It's often hard to locate Du Pre as he is seen, variously, navigating a Canadian river, drinking with his lover Madelaine and playing with his grandchildren. But Bowen's prose is often droll and his characters well-etched; only clue seekers are in for a lean time here. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Frederick Jackson Turner: historian, scholar, teacher</h2><p>Contents: From boyhood to manhood, 1861-1884 -- The making of a historian : Wisconsin, 1884-1888 -- The making of a historian : John Hopkins, 1888-1889 -- Teaching : and the emerging frontier thesis, 1892-1893 -- The busy world of the professor, 1893-1901 -- Broadening historical horizons, 1893-1910 -- Popularizing the frontier thesis, 1893-1910 -- The genesis of the sectional concept, 1893-1910 -- Teacher and administrator, 1910-1910 -- Undergraduate teacher and reformer, 1901-1910 -- Leaving Wisconsin, 1905-1910 -- Harvard years : the academic world, 1910-1917 -- Harvard years : conflict, academic and international, 1915-1920 -- Harvard years : the world of scholarship, 1917-1924 -- The twilight years, 1924-1932 -- Frederick Jackson Turner : a portrait of the man -- The persistence of a theory : the frontier and sectional hypotheses -- The significance of Frederick Jackson Turner in American History.</p><p></p><h2>Betty Crocker&#39;s New Cookbook</h2><p>Trust <i>Betty Crocker's New Cookbook</i> to be your one-stop kitchen reference.

Shocked and angered by this gruesome discovery, she vowed to find a way to stop the cruel round-ups, a resolution that led to a life-long battle that would pit her against ranchers and powerful politicians&#x2014;but eventually win her support and admiration around the world. This is the first biography to tell her courageous true story..<p>Like Dian Fossey, Jane Goodall, or Temple Grandin, Velma Johnston dedicated her life to public awareness and protection of animals. <i>Wild Horse Annie</i> <i>and the Last of the Mustangs</i> follows Velma from her childhood, in which she was disfigured by polio, to her dangerous vigilante-style missions to free captured horses and document round-ups, through the innovative and exhaustive grassroots campaign which earned her the nickname &#x201c;Wild Horse Annie&#x201d; and led to Congress passing the &#x201c;Wild Horse Annie Bill,&#x201d; to her friendship with renowned children&#x2019;s author and horse-lover Marguerite Henry..</p><p>A powerful combination of adventure, history, and biography, <i>Wild Horse Annie and the Last of the Mustangs</i> beautifully captures the romance and magic of wild horses and the character of the strong-willed woman who made their survival her legacy. .</p></p><p>&nbsp;<b>David Cruise</b> and <b>Alison Griffiths</b> began writing together in 1983 and are the authors of seven bestselling books, including <i>Fleecing the Lamb</i>,<i> Lords of the Line</i>,<i> Net Worth</i>,<i> On South Mountain</i>, and <i>The Great Adventure.</i> Griffiths hosted the acclaimed financial television show &#x201c;Maxed Out,&#x201d; for three years and she writes the nationally syndicated columns, Alison on Money and Me and My Money. &nbsp;They have two daughters and divide their time between their small farms in southwestern Ontario and Brooksville, Florida.&nbsp;Please visit wildhorseanniestory.com<b><b>-FOUR-<br><i>The Road to Reno</i></b></b> <p>EXCEPT FOR TWO weeks of holidays in the summer and a week at Christmas, Velma rose before the sun every Monday, the day she left for her other life in Reno. Getting up was always a chore; she uncoiled herself one limb at a time, waiting a minute or two to allow the ache to subside. She took care not to exert too much pressure on any single joint. Once she was up, she felt some relief. </p><p>It was a matter of pride to Velma that no one, not even Charlie, realized the full extent of her discomfort. If anyone noticed a wince or gasp she couldn&#x2019;t stifle, she&#x2019;d retort dismissively, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m middle-aged and still kicking! A little twinge here and there isn&#x2019;t going to do me in yet. All I need is a tight girdle and a case of hair spray to keep me going.&#x201d; </p><p>Most Mondays Charlie was still asleep and snoring heavily in his bed near the fireplace when Velma brewed a pot of strong coffee and smoked her first cigarette of the day. Then she&#x2019;d slip into her tattered, fringed leather jacket, check the pocket for carrots, and stroll across the fields and down toward the river to caress Hobo&#x2019;s nose and say good-bye for the week. Horses are simple animals, all stomach and fear, food and flight, but in times of calm the gut rules. The old admonition about &#x201c;give &#x2019;em an inch&#x201d; must have been written with a horse in mind. Charlie didn&#x2019;t like her hand-feeding the horses, knowing they could become nippy and aggressive. But Hobo was a gentleman who waited patiently until the treats were offered. </p><p>Each Monday Velma left herself enough time to stop for coffee and a chat with her mother before she was due at the office. From the ranch it was only twenty-six miles to Reno, but it took close to an hour on the twisting gravel road, an interlude that allowed her to make the transition from the Double Lazy Heart to the busiest insurance company in the region. Velma drove confidently, even a bit aggressively, a cigarette spiraling smoke from the dashboard ashtray. </p><p>One spring morning in 1950 the trip passed uneventfully until she caught up with a livestock truck. Despite a postwar population boom, there were fewer than sixteen hundred licensed vehicles in the state, three-quarters of them in the Las Vegas area, so any traffic this early in the morning on a lightly traveled road in west central Nevada was unusual. The old truck with wooden slat sides and a canvas roof was obviously heavily loaded; it moved slowly, kicking up puffs of dust in its wake. As Velma pulled closer looking for an opportunity to pass, she noticed a dark fluid glistening on the bumper and dripping onto the road. Blood. She suspected it came from an injured steer or sheep. </p><p>Though accidents happened when transporting livestock, especially along rough roads in the spring with potholes formed in the frost-heaved ground, ranchers were usually careful hauling cattle or sheep because they were paid by the pound on the hoof. On long trips, stressed livestock lost weight, which meant money gone from the rancher&#x2019;s pocket. It was worse if there were serious injuries, since the slaughterhouse would refuse animals that couldn&#x2019;t walk off the truck. The law required livestock haulers to stop regularly to feed and water the animals at a secure facility where they could be unloaded and reloaded safely. However, it was different for animals not intended for human consumption. The Killer Rate Exemption spared truckers the time spent watering or feeding the animals en route. </p><p>The livestock in the truck might also have come from one of the so-called tax-dodge ranches, operations with absentee owners notorious for their neglect of their animals. All they were interested in was the tax write-off for ranching. Nevada had more than its share of such ranchers because the state offered generous incentives to attract and keep people on the land. After mining activity dropped off in the postwar years, ranching became the state&#x2019;s lifeblood, and the Nevada tax structure was aimed at providing the best possible environment for ranchers. Free of state income taxes, ranchers could put every penny they made back into their operations. And when they died, there were no worries about crippling inheritance taxes, forcing children to sell the land their parents had worked for decades. </p><p>There were also federal government concessions and healthy subsidies for those who would grow food on the hoof or in the ground. No one wanted a repeat of the exodus that had occurred during the dust bowl years, a flight from farm and ranching communities that had never been completely reversed, despite innumerable government programs aimed at repopulating rural land. While incentives breathed some life back into ranching, they also attracted those who saw an opportunity for an easy tax credit, a hobby, or a get-rich-quick scheme. Native Nevadans dismissed the tax-write-off ranchers as carpetbagging easterners. But many of the well-to-do in Las Vegas and Reno owned ranches for the tax benefits. </p><p>As Velma followed the listing truck, the dribble of blood increased until it was a steady flow, too much for a single hurt animal. She hated the idea of animals suffering but no one, especially ranchers, liked busybodies. Still, Velma decided it was her duty to alert the driver in case he didn&#x2019;t know. She followed the truck into the Sparks stockyards, four miles east of Reno&#x2019;s downtown. </p><p>Velma walked over and peered through a gap in the slats, expecting to find cattle or sheep. Instead she saw a horrifying tableau of mutilated horses, some barely alive. Her eyes caught sight of a colt, or what was left of him, lying trampled, his bones crushed and coat blood-soaked. A number of horses had bloody stumps instead of legs. Others had sections of their hooves torn off and hides shredded by buckshot. A stallion stood with his head bowed, blood seeping from empty eye sockets. He had been blinded to subdue him. It was only the tight quarters that kept many of the horses upright. A penetrating stench, the combination of blood, urine, and feces, rose from the truck while flies swarmed over the brutalized animals, jammed so tightly they couldn&#x2019;t flick the insects away with their tails. </p><p>&#x201c;Where did these horses come from and why are they in such terrible condition?&#x201d; Velma gasped. </p><p>&#x201c;Oh, they were run in by plane out there,&#x201d; the driver replied, indicating the hills of the Comstock Lode. </p><p>Velma was sensitive when it came to animals, but she wasn&#x2019;t squeamish. She&#x2019;d stood by Charlie when he&#x2019;d been forced to put a calf out of its misery after a birth gone wrong, and then there were all those puppy litters. She&#x2019;d hardly shed tears since her days in the polio cast. But what she saw on that truck was beyond anything she&#x2019;d ever experienced. </p><p>&#x201c;No point in crying your eyes out over a bunch of useless mustangs,&#x201d; the driver told her. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll all be dead soon anyway.&#x201d; </p><p>VELMA WAS ETERMINED to do something about the atrocity she&#x2019;d witnessed at the Sparks stockyards&#x2014;but what? There was no wildlife protection agency to call, no advocacy group to alert. She didn&#x2019;t even know if the capture and brutalization of wild horses was illegal. Velma was a right-of-center Republican who followed politics in the newspaper, but she had neither government connections nor any direct experience of the political process. Though she had a passing acquaintance with the wealthy, politically active James Slattery, who owned property near the Double Lazy Heart, she didn&#x2019;t know him well enough to call on him for advice. </p><p>After a sleepless night, Velma resolved to learn as much as she could about wild horses. For the next week she arrived at work an hour ahead of schedule and left an hour early in order to spend time at the library before it closed. She found a few files of relevant newspaper clippings and a handful of magazine articles. Most were romantic pieces extolling the chase of mustangs for sport or stories of legendary wild horses like the Pacing White Mustang of the Cimarron, who eluded his frustrated pursuers for decades. There were plenty of local news stories about marauding stallions stealing mares from ranchers and later being captured or shot. She found dozens of place names throughout the West that commemorated mustangs&#x2014;Wild Horse Mountain, Red Horse Creek, Red Roan River, Wild Horse Plains, Broomtail Flat, Pony Hills, Mustang Bayou, Wild Horse Gap, and Mestano Mesa&#x2014;but very little information about the horses that inspired those names. </p><p>There were books by admirers and students of the wild horse, authors such as the famous Texas folklorist and mustanger Frank Dobie, who opined that there were plenty of dumb men in the world but he had never come across a dumb mustang. &#x201c;No one who conceives him as only a potential servant to man can apprehend the mustang,&#x201d; he observed. &#x201c;The true conceiver must be a true lover of freedom&#x2014;a person who yearns to extend freedom to all life. Halted in animated expectancy or running in abandoned freedom, the mustang was the most beautiful, most spirited, and most inspiring creature ever to print foot on the grasses of America.&#x201d;1 </p><p>Other mustangers wrote fulsome, self-aggrandizing accounts of their escapades; a few offered poignant descriptions of an era and a vocation that were receding into history by 1950. Wild horses had been pursued from Mexico to Canada for over three centuries. Most old-time mustangers had at least a grudging respect for their prey. Many were professionals whose livelihoods depended on capturing as many horses as possible, but the animals had to be in good condition or they couldn&#x2019;t be sold. </p><p>A few mustangers became celebrities, their exploits and record numbers of captures admiringly reported in the popular press. Former buffalo hunter Buffalo Jones reinvented himself as a flamboyant mustang showman in the tradition of Buffalo Bill Cody, and in 1912 he staged a mustang chase through the streets o...</p></p><h2>With A Listening Heart: Biblical And Spiritual Reflections On The Psalms</h2><p>How does a person approach the Book of Psalms, this compilation of ancient poetic writings whose beauty and meaning are often obscured by the language, culture and time in which they were written? Exegetes and scholars have done much of the work for us and we find their conclusions set forth in this highly readable book whose very title sums up the approach that we must take: The Psalms are to be read and prayed with a listening heart. Lev shome&#39;a in Hebrew. Oh, that today you would listen to his voice. we read in Psalm 95:7, harden not your heart. An open heart and an attentive ear are required if we are to enter into the spirit and meaning of these great prayers of the Hebrew and Christian faith. the author has painstakingly taken each of the 150 psalms in order and succinctly pointed out what we would do well to look for if we are to cull the maximum benefit from them. In addition, he indicates what he has derived from his own prayerful reflection on the text. With this work in one hand and the psalms in the other, the reader will reap the abundant rewards reserved for those who have a listening heart.</p><p></p><h2>Poppy&#39;s Recipe for Life: Treat yourself to the gloriously uplifting new book from the Sunday Times bestselling author!</h2><p><b>The heart-warming new novel from the&nbsp;<i>Sunday Times</i> bestselling author, perfect for fans of Carole Matthews, Milly Johnson and Cathy Bramley</b><br><br><b>Heidi Swain is the perfect summer read!</b><br><br> Praise for Heidi Swain:<br><br> &#x2018;<b>Wise</b>, <b>warm</b> and <b>wonderful</b> &#x2013; a real <b>summer</b><b>treat</b>!&#x2019; <b><i>heat&nbsp;</i></b>magazine<br><br> 'A <b>fabulous feel good read</b> &#x2013; a ray of <b>reading sunshine</b>!&#x2019; LAURA KEMP, author of <i>A Year of Surprising Acts of Kindness</i><br><br> '<b>This book had it all </b>for me!

What we now recognise as consumer society originated in that period, and it was mass culture, the first &#x2018;culture industry&#x2019;, that helped bring it into being.<br><br>In a magisterial study of the process, Richard Ohmann surveys the new practices of advertising, mass distribution of goods, and, most important, the birth of the inexpensive mass-audience magazine to analyse the creation of the American professional-managerial class. Drawing upon work in economic, cultural, and social history, he integrates the seemingly disparate phenomena of modern middle-class life in a coherent tale of how the class was formed and came to occupy the foreground in the malign ideological formation, &#x2018;the American Dream.&#x2019;<br><br>Elegantly written, lucidly argued, and brimming with arresting facts and incidents, <i>Selling Culture</i> offers the definitive account of the relation between culture and economy in the transformation of the United States into a mass-consumption, mass-mediated society.</p><p>Richard Ohmann is Professor of English at Wesleyan University.Drawing, in part, from what the author, a former editor of College English, calls "the broad marxist tradition," this is a highly ideological social and economic history of the rise of low-cost, high-circulation monthly magazines in America at the end of the 19th century. The era marked what Ohmann sees as the beginning of a nationwide mass culture rooted in advertising that continues to this day, a culture based on using information and entertainment as commodities. Thanks to developments in technology, Ohmann notes, the U.S. moved from being an industrial country to a marketing one; and along the way, a professional managerial class established itself. Among the magazines given special attention (including a study of the fiction published) are Munsey's, McClure's and Ladies' Home Journal. Topics touched on include the birth of department stores, mail order and chain stores; the rise of the suburbs; and the triumph of advertising agencies, which, according to Ohmann, articulated the goals and formulated the strategies of "the big bourgeoisie." Less politically-minded readers might be tempted to skip the ideological sections and mine this highly researched study for the rich?indeed lavish?amount of raw information it contains on the growth of popular culture.

Stitch explanations are provided with each pattern--where knitters need them. A nice resource for the avid knitter looking for the next project. <i>Jennifer Palmer</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For more than a century, science has cultivated a sober public image for itself. But as bestselling author Michael Brooks explains, the truth is very different: many of our most successful scientists have more in common with libertines than librarians. This thrilling exploration of some of the greatest breakthroughs in science reveals the extreme lengths some scientists go to in order to make their theories public. Fraud, suppressing evidence and unethical or reckless PR games are sometimes necessary to bring the best and most brilliant discoveries to the world&#39;s attention. Inspiration can come from the most unorthodox of places, and Brooks introduces us to Nobel laureates who get their ideas through drugs, dreams and hallucinations. Science is a highly competitive and ruthless discipline, and only its most determined and passionate practitioners make headlines - and history. To succeed, knowledge must be pursued by any means: in science, anything goes.</p><p>Michael Brooks is the author of the bestselling non-fiction title 13 Things That Don&#39;t Make Sense.

Inspiring lessons about living and thriving with dementia."<b>---Maria Shriver, NBC's <i>Today </i>Show</b><br></strong><br>A "courageous and singular book" (Andrew Solomon), <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is an unsparing, beautifully written memoir--"an intimate, revealing account of living with dementia" (<em>Shelf Awareness</em>).<br><br>Based on the "field notes" she keeps in her journal, <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is Gerda Saunders' astonishing window into a life distorted by dementia. She writes about shopping trips cut short by unintentional shoplifting, car journeys derailed when she loses her bearings, and the embarrassment of forgetting what she has just said to a room of colleagues. Coping with the complications of losing short-term memory, Saunders, a former university professor, nonetheless embarks on a personal investigation of the brain and its mysteries, examining science and literature, and immersing herself in vivid memories of her childhood in South Africa.</p><p><strong>Gerda Saunders</strong> emigrated to the United States from South Africa in 1984. In 1996 she received a PhD in English from the University of Utah, where she later served as associate director of the Gender Studies Program. Saunders is the author of the short story collection <em>Blessings on the Sheep Dog</em>. She has spoken with the BBC and <i>The Huffington Post</i> about living with dementia, and is the subject of a series of short films being produced by VideoWest and featured on <i>Slate</i>."The book is remarkable not only for its fiercely honest, sometimes-poetic portrayal of mental decline, but also for the way the author effectively celebrates 'the magisteria of a mind'.... A courageous, richly textured, and unsparing memoir."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i> (starred review)</i></b><br><br>"[A] deeply emotional and humbling memoir...a work of breathtaking defiance."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"This courageous and singular book describes both the indignities inscribed in the erosion of memory and the surprising grace to be found in that experience. At once observer and subject, Gerda Saunders demonstrates how a powerful intellect can remain undiminished even as other mental capacities are compromised. Her book's lessons in dignity will be invaluable to anyone facing the complex meanings of dementia."&#x2015;<b><i>Andrew Solomon, National Book Award-winning author of <i>The Noonday Demon</i> and <i>Far from the Tree </i></i></b><br><br>"The abrupt loss of everyday memory due to brain injury is swiftly and seriously unsettling. Its slower, subtle decline, the hallmark of dementia, provides time for introspection on its troubling trajectory. Gerda Saunders has given us a window into that chilling, yet poignant, psychological reality. <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is personal, lucid, and inspiring."&#x2015;<b><i>Dr. Michael Gazzaniga, Director of the SAGE Center for the Study of Mind at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of <i>Tales from Both Sides of the Brain: A Life in Neuroscience</i></i></b><br><br>"Navigating the onset of her own dementia with intelligence and charm, Gerda Saunders has written an engaging m�lange of reflection, family history and quest. <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is a surprising and subtly triumphant contribution to the literature of recollection."&#x2015;<b><i>Honor Moore, author of <i>The Bishop's Daughter</i></i></b><br><br>"Gerda Saunders' <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is not only a how-to manual for navigating the emotional and physiological terrain of dementia--an illness that effects the daily lives and hopes of millions--but a highly compelling account of the life of the mind, its developments, repetitions, omissions, and flourishes. Through eloquent, unwavering prose, Saunders guides us through the horrors and humors of an illness that is slowly erasing her mental and physical memory; her insights are lessons in longevity. Above all things, <i>Memory's Last Breath</i> is indelible--a testament to the capacity of language both in a writer's life and a reader's." <br>&#x2015;<b><i>Ann Neumann, author of <i>The Good Death</i></i></b><br><br>"Saunders...writes bravely about her early-onset dementia diagnosis, and nicely bridges the intensely personal experience of her failing mind with examinations of neurological science.... Her evocative writing shows her to be a researcher and craftswoman."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i></i></b><br><br>"The book (with its astonishing subtitle: 'Field Notes on My Dementia') is a literary achievement ... blend[ing] meditations on memory and identity with brain science, rooted by the writer's anthropologic jottings of daily misadventures."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Salt Lake Tribune</em></i></b><br><br>"An intimate, revealing account of living with dementia.... Saunders approaches some of the most difficult questions a human being can face with clarity and wisdom."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Shelf Awareness</em></i></b><br><br>"Melodious.... The last chapter is stunning in both senses of the word, gorgeous and shocking... A graceful, innovative writer.... Saunders's awareness of her own mortality has turned her into an omniscient eye."&#x2015;<b><i>Jennifer Senior, <em>New York Times</em></i></b></p><h2>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (A Lullaby Book With Lights and Music)</h2><p>Tells of the coming of evening to one country house, with a twinkling star and a tab to pull that plays the melody of this children&#39;s song.</p><p>The afternoon fades, twilight descends and the dark of night settles over a snug, stucco house, which is viewed at first from a distance, then up close.

She earned both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Reed College, and currently lives in Lake Oswego, Oregon.The rustic connotation of the cabin, with basic comfort, is a starting point for Paul. However, it is the relationship of the cabin to its surroundings and its occupants that defines its substance and character. Paul focuses on 29 cabins with unique aesthetic-architectural appeal. She includes a little-known Nevada cabin designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and settings as varied as dunes and mountains. But it is the placement of the cabin--its use and purposes for the occupant--upon which its aesthetic function turns. Paul's photographs and writing bring to life old cabins made new, new cabins made to look old, numerous designs that appear to envelop or reflect a part of the landscape, and others to stand out. What is particularly appealing is how the cabins' occupants have incorporated the outdoors and scenery into interior living space. The sizes, styles, materials, and interiors are quite varied and beautiful. The emphasis on the organic function of the cabin, as well as Paul's stunning photographs, brings to life an inviting quest to get away. <i>Vernon Ford</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Mammals is arranged so "look-alikes" appear together, such as the common raccoon teamed with the similar ringtail and white-nosed coati. Thumbnail-sized range maps are included, as are drawings of the animals' tracks. Weather includes facts on a wide variety of phenomena, from the expected spectrum of clouds and fronts to the more unusual dust devils and green flash. In both, the texts are occasionally printed over photo images, making them difficult to decipher. Each book has a glossary, a list of further readings (quite excellent in Weather), pertinent videos and discs, related Web sites, and organizations to contact for additional data. Both are indexed, though the index in Weather is somewhat brief. Well organized, eye-catching, and informative, these volumes are sure to capture the popularity long enjoyed by the "Golden Guide" series (Golden).<br><i>Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Goldenhand: The latest thrilling adventure in the internationally bestselling fantasy series (The Old Kingdom)</h2><p>Goldenhand is the long-awaited fifth installment of Garth Nix&#39;s New York Times bestselling Old Kingdom series Lirael is no longer a shy Second Assistant Librarian. She is the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, with dead creatures to battle and Free Magic entities to bind. She&#39;s also a Remembrancer, and wielder of the Dark Mirror. When Lirael finds Nicholas Sayre lying unconscious after being attacked by a hideous Free Magic creature, she uses her powers to save him. But Nicholas is deeply tainted with Free magic and Lirael must seek help for him at her childhood home, the Clayr&#39;s Glacier. But even as she returns to the Clayr, a messenger is trying to reach Lirael with a dire warning from her long-dead mother, Arielle, about the Witch with No Face. But who is the Witch, and what is she planning? Once more a great danger threatens the Old Kingdom, and it must be forestalled not only in the living world, but also in the cold, remorseless river of Death.</p><p>Garth Nix was born in 1963 in Melbourne, Australia.

Follow Garth on twitter at @garthnix or at www.garthnix.comGr 8 Up&#x2014;In this brilliant installment of the series, the once shy Lirael steps boldly into her duties as Abhorsen-in-Waiting. While Nix brings back many other familiar characters, he begins on the far side of the Greenwash River Bridge with a young woman of the clans who roam north of the kingdom. Ferin bears a vital message for Lirael and the Clayr from one of their own who traveled north long ago. She is pursued by shamans who can summon Free Magic creatures as well as a necromancer who can call the Dead. Meanwhile, Lirael is called south, beyond the Wall to the Ancelstierre, where she must rescue Nicholas Sayre from a Hrule, a fell creature of Free Magic. Nicholas is sorely wounded, so Lirael must transport him via paperwing to the glacier of the Clayr, the only place in the Old Kingdom where they possess the knowledge and the skill to treat him. Ferin and Lirael will meet in the Clayr's glacier to discuss with Sabriel, Touchstone, and other formidable figures the great threat that looms. Nix's terrific characters enliven the story, while moments of peril provide the rhythm. He even includes some cameos from characters who readers might not expect. His wonderfully imagined world is full of rich details and where Charter Magic flows through and protects humanity. VERDICT For fantasy lovers, teens and adults alike.&#x2014;Eric Norton, McMillan Memorial Library, Wisconsin Rapids, WI</p><h2>Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s</h2><p>The comedians of the 1950s and 1960s were a totally different breed of relevant, revolutionary performer from any that came before or after, comics whose humor did much more than pry guffaws out of audiences. Gerald Nachman presents the stories of the groundbreaking comedy stars of those years, each one a cultural harbinger: <br><br>� Mort Sahl, of a new political cynicism <br>� Lenny Bruce, of the sexual, drug, and language revolution<br>� Dick Gregory, of racial unrest <br>� Bill Cosby and Godfrey Cambridge, of racial harmony <br>� Phyllis Diller, of housewifely complaint<br>� Mike Nichols &amp; Elaine May and Woody Allen, of self-analytical angst and a rearrangement of male-female relations<br>� Stan Freberg and Bob Newhart, of encroaching, pervasive pop media manipulation and, in the case of Bob Elliott &amp; Ray Goulding, of the banalities of broadcasting <br>� Mel Brooks, of the Yiddishization of American comedy<br>� Sid Caesar, of a new awareness of the satirical possibilities of television<br>� Joan Rivers, of the obsessive craving for celebrity gossip and of a latent bitchy sensibility<br>� Tom Lehrer, of the inane, hypocritical, mawkishly sentimental nature of hallowed American folkways and, in the case of the Smothers Brothers, of overly revered folk songs and folklore<br>� Steve Allen, of the late-night talk show as a force in American comedy<br>� David Frye and Vaughn Meader, of the merger of showbiz and politics and, along with Will Jordan, of stretching the boundaries of mimicry<br>� Shelley Berman, of a generation of obsessively self-confessional humor <br>� Jonathan Winters and Jean Shepherd, of the daring new free-form improvisational comedy and of a sardonically updated view of Midwestern archetypes<br>� Ernie Kovacs, of surreal visual effects and the unbounded vistas of video<br><br>Taken together, they made up the faculty of a new school of vigorous, socially aware satire, a vibrant group of voices that reigned from approximately 1953 to 1965. <br><br>Nachman shines a flashlight into the corners of these comedians&#x2019; chaotic and often troubled lives, illuminating their genius as well as their demons, damaged souls, and desperate drive. His exhaustive research and intimate interviews reveal characters that are intriguing and all too human, full of rich stories, confessions, regrets, and traumas. Seriously Funny is at once a dazzling cultural history and a joyous celebration of an extraordinary era in American comedy.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>It's been said that analyzing comedy is a bit like dissecting a frog: you arrive at a greater understanding of the frog but the frog does tend to die in the process. The purpose of Gerald Nachman's <i>Seriously Funny: The Rebel Comedians of the 1950s and 1960s</i> is not to provide a laugh riot of his subjects' best punch lines, but rather to explore their lives, careers, and influence. Nachman's scope is impressive. He provides detailed biographies not only of household names Sid Caesar, Lenny Bruce, Bob Newhart, and Woody Allen but also comics like Jean Shepherd, Shelley Berman, and Will Jordan whose legacies have far outpaced their name recognition. Nachman has done his research; the book profiles 26 comedians, each in exhaustive detail, and no fan of this era will feel cheated at the end of its 768 pages. There are plenty of entertaining show biz anecdotes (Sid Caesar throwing a lit cigar at young writer Mel Brooks, Bill Cosby punching out Tommy Smothers) along with tales of the darker sides of Mort Sahl, Jonathan Winters, and others whose private lives were far less amusing than their stage acts. But what makes <i>Seriously Funny</i> so compelling, and its dopey title at least partially forgivable, is the author's meticulous attention to each comedian's imprint on the landscape of comedy itself. And while the jokes cited often seem a bit stale and obvious, it bears noting that they were revolutionary when these comedians first made them. <i>--John Moe</i>Gerald Nachman has for more than forty years covered theater, movies, cabaret, and television for newspapers and magazines. His previous books include <b>Raised on Radio</b>; two collections of humor pieces, <b>Out on a Whim </b>and<b> The Fragile Bachelor</b>; and a humorous book on marriage, <b>Playing House</b>.

A physician called this the most stolen book from his waiting room! Available in English, Spanish and Japanese.</p><p>Champion K. Teutsch (pronounced toy-ch), a Ph.D. in psychology, in conjunction with his late-wife Joel Marie Teutsch developed a unique scientific approach to the solution for every kind of problem. Thanks to her mastery of the code underlying the Bible, Joel was a remarkable healer and conceptual innovator. Among her grateful students were psychiatrists, physicians, psychologists, educators and ministers. Teutsch has triumphed in many cases that did not respond to traditional medical, psychiatric and psychological techniques. The Teutsch IDEAL Method combines the rigor of physics, genetics and spiritual law. It has been effective in such diversified fields as: <p>A. Marriage and Relationships<br> B. Job, Business and Career<br> C. Health </p><p>Teutsch's intensive research proved that the same genetic code that determines man's physical appearance prenatally also decrees his outlook on life, behavior and experience. Most important, he discovered a unique and effective way to modify undesirable hereditary predispositions. In contrast to traditional techniques, he gets quick and lasting results. Once Teutsch helps his client break his genetic code, the sky is the limit. </p><p>For the past 39 years, Teutsch has been in private practice as a psycho-geneticist, gene-physicist or simply a success coach. In this capacity, he has handled over 100,000 men, women, and children from every age group, background and field of endeavor in person or by long-distance telephone. </p><p>Teutsch's clients include U.S. presidents and congressmen, Emmy and Oscar winners like Louis Gossett Jr. and Jack Palance, as well as physicians, attorneys and realtors plus insurance and engineering firms. </p><p>Teutsch was a popular guest on many radio shows and such TV shows as The Tonight Show and Donahue. He is listed in Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the World, Who's Who in Medicine and Healthcare and Who's Who in Science and Engineering. </p><p>After demonstrating his expertise on a complex case, Teutsch was named visiting professor of medicine by the dean at the University of Florida's medical college. He has discussed his method at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, where he enabled a 35-year old TV personality to embark upon a successful teaching career after her case had baffled, for two futile years, a team of eight physicians and two clinical psychologists who labeled her, falsely, according to Teutsch, as a catatonic schizophrenic. </p><p>In 1993, Teutsch was named chairman of the International Human Research Center "SunRay" in Moscow-Russia, where he gave seminars and private consultations. He also lectured at Moscow State University. Teutsch conducted seminars and private consultations in Tokyo-Japan, Tel Aviv-Israel and Munich-Germany. </p><p>On April 21, 1999, the Russian Federation's Ministry of Justice officially endorsed the Teutsch's psychogenetics for human improvement. In order to save lives, heartaches and expense, Teutsch is prepared to share his research results and expertise with physicians, public health officials, educators and concerned parents.</p>One does not have to know anything about gravity to be subject to the law governing this important force. By the same token, no man has ever seen electricity, but we all are using it in different ways. The same goes for the laws of mind. Although we may be unaware of their existence, we are nevertheless affected by them every second of our lives. <p>Mind, as we call or know it, cannot be seen. But it does not require much reflection to realize that it is a potent, ever-present reality. For a long time, the brain was considered to be the seat of the our mind, essential for our survival as an intelligent being. Recent evidence has destroyed this belief. The reasoning and acting ability of a few war victims deprived of one or both cerebral hemispheres was found to be unimpaired. As a result, we are forced to conclude that the mind is our invisible control center, with the brain merely acting as its physical agent and symbol. </p><p>This is by no means intended to imply that the brain is unnecessary. What it does prove, however, is that the brain is controlled by mind. Mind, being greater than the brain, can under certain conditions take over and perform the functions of the brain, in addition to its own.</p></p><h2>How to Raise a Healthy Child in Spite of Your Doctor</h2><p>HOW TO RAISE A HEALTHY CHILD IN SPITE OF YOUR DOCTOR by Robert S.

Especially the night before your first day of school.<br></li></ol><br>Liberty Porter had only learned this last one this morning. She had sneaked an extra cookie after dinner last night. Okay, three. And now she was lying in bed with a sickish stomach. She was slightly nauseous and also slightly nervous. Because today was Liberty Porter&#x2019;s first day at her new school!<br><br>She had woken up way before her alarm clock was set to ring. It was so early that it was dark outside, but she couldn&#x2019;t go back to sleep. She thought about getting up and going out into the house. But she didn&#x2019;t want to wake her parents up. The president of the United States had to get a good night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what her mom had told her the first morning, after Liberty woke up before her parents and went to the White House movie theater. She hadn&#x2019;t meant to turn the volume up <i>that</i> loud.<br><br>And what her mom had said the second morning, after Liberty had woken up before her parents and decided to play upstairs. She had planned to play the drums in the music room softly. But . . . well . . . they were drums.<br><br>So now she just lay quietly in her bed, thinking about the first day of school.<br><br>Liberty Porter was not the first kid who lived in the White House to go to school, of course. And some First Kids even went to school right <i>inside</i> the White House. President Lincoln&#x2019;s and President Hayes&#x2019;s children were homeschooled right down the hall from Liberty&#x2019;s bedroom. President Kennedy had made a first-grade classroom for his daughter and ten students upstairs on the third floor.<br><br>Liberty would go to a fourth-grade classroom at a nearby school. Everyone else had started at that school in the fall. Liberty would be the only new kid. And the only First Kid. Everyone knew she was starting school. It was big news. It was such big news it was even on the news.<br><br>&#x201c;First Daughter Liberty Porter heads off for her first day of school tomorrow!&#x201d; the announcer had said on the television news yesterday.<br><br>Suddenly Liberty felt really, really nervous. She picked up her new beanie rottweiler, Alice.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been to a new school before,&#x201d; she told Alice.<br><br>Liberty did not know what this new school would be like at all!<br><br>Liberty had gone to the same school her whole entire life. She knew everybody. Everybody knew her. She had known that Perfect Paige would be perfect. She had known that Max Mellon would be annoying.<br><br>Liberty thought about her last day at her school. Most people in her class had said they&#x2019;d miss her. They even made a card for her that said &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll Miss You, Liberty!&#x201d;<br><br>Liberty had felt sad when she&#x2019;d gotten the card. She even started to cry a little bit. She had sniffled and then blew her nose. Unfortunately she blew her nose a little loud and Max Mellon heard her.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha!&#x201d; Max had laughed. &#x201c;Liberty snorted!&#x201d;<br><br>The rest of the day Max had called her by a new nickname:<br><br>Pig-gerty Porter, First Snorter.<br><br>Liberty had a very cheerful thought about her new school: Max Mellon would not be there.<br><br>Then Liberty heard something outside in the hallway. Footsteps! &#x201c;Franklin,&#x201d; she whispered. &#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d;<br><br>Franklin was sleeping in his dog bed in the corner. His ears perked up and he listened.<br><br>Who was walking down the hall? Liberty had an idea! Some people had said they heard footsteps in the middle of the night at the White House . . . and they thought it was Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s ghost.<br><br>Seriously! People thought they heard or saw Lincoln&#x2019;s ghost. And not just any people, but presidents. Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, and Hoover all thought they heard the ghost knock on their bedroom doors.<br><br>Liberty had thought she wanted to meet Lincoln&#x2019;s ghost. But now she wasn&#x2019;t so sure.<br><br>And then there was a knock on Liberty&#x2019;s door! <i>Knock! Knock!</i><br><br>And then the door opened. <i>Creeeaaaak!</i><br><br><i>&#x201c;Eeps!&#x201d;</i> Liberty squeaked. She dived under the covers. Her heart was beating like crazy.<br><br>&#x201c;Liberty?&#x201d; a voice said. Was it the ghost?<br><br>Her bedroom light clicked on. No. It was not the ghost of President Lincoln. It was just her father, President Porter!<br><br><i>Whhhhhew!</i> Liberty&#x2019;s heart pounded a little bit slower.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Liberty Bell!&#x201d; her dad said. He paused. &#x201c;Liberty? Are you in there?&#x201d;<br><br>Liberty crawled out from under the covers. She saw her father in the doorway. He was wearing his suit and tie already. Franklin got up and trotted over for his morning scratches.<br><br>&#x201c;Hi, Daddy,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Happy First Day of School!&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know why you woke up so early. You couldn&#x2019;t wait for my Traditional First Day of School Porter Pancakes.<br><br>&#x201c;You are one lucky girl,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your second time to get my traditional first day of school pancakes in <i>one year.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup,&#x201d; Liberty agreed. &#x201c;Lucky me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The best pancakes ever,&#x201d; her father said. &#x201c;Nobody makes pancakes as good as mine.&#x201d;<br><br>Erm. Liberty didn&#x2019;t quite answer that one. Her father was going to be a great leader of the most powerful country in the world. But his pancakes tasted like soap.<br><br>&#x201c;Just because I&#x2019;m president doesn&#x2019;t mean I would give up making my famous pancakes,&#x201d; her dad was saying. &#x201c;In fact, now we can call them Porter Presidential Pancakes!&#x201d;<br><br>Liberty was hoping they could call the chef downstairs for breakfast. But the pancake tradition made her father so happy.<br><br>Maybe the chefs could sneak her something later. Liberty still couldn&#x2019;t believe she lived in a house that had chefs. They cooked in a huge kitchen downstairs. And not just a huge kitchen, but a pastry shop where they made cookies, cupcakes, brownies. . . . And not only a pastry shop, but a chocolate shop.<br><br>Yes, a whole room in her house where chefs made chocolate! Liberty zoned out for a minute thinking about the chocolate shop. <i>Mmmmm</i>. Chocolate shop.<br><br>Liberty jumped out of bed and followed her dad down to the kitchen. She sat at the table and watched him as he began to mix the pancake batter. He was wearing a long chef&#x2019;s apron over his suit so he wouldn&#x2019;t get dirty.<br><br>&#x201c;What could be better than my special pancakes?&#x201d; her dad was saying, peeking into the pancake maker. &#x201c;Special pancakes for a special occasion.&#x201d;<br><br>Special occasion! Those two words made Liberty remember something. Something very, very good.<br><br>Liberty had been asking to visit the chocolate shop for treats.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to save that for special occasions,&#x201d; her mother kept telling her. But now her dad said it was a special occasion!<br><br>&#x201c;I need to go somewhere really quick,&#x201d; Liberty said.<br><br>&#x201c;Be back in five minutes for your pancakes!&#x201d; he said cheerfully.<br><br>&#x201c;I will!&#x201d; Liberty said, getting up from the kitchen table. She waved to Franklin to follow her out of the kitchen and into the hall.<br><br>Liberty and Franklin headed to the door that led away from the president&#x2019;s family&#x2019;s part of the house.<br><br>The White House has 132 rooms on three floors. The second and third floors are where the president and his family live. Liberty had gotten lost a lot the first couple days. But now she knew where everything was. Especially the most important places like the movie theater and bowling alley. And the chocolate shop.<br><br>Liberty opened the door to go downstairs.<br><br>SAM was standing right outside the door, ready to go. SAM was one of Liberty&#x2019;s Secret Service agents. SAM was very tall and had no hair. He always wore a dark secret agent suit and an earpiece in his ear and sometimes he wore very cool sunglasses.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Liberty,&#x201d; SAM said. &#x201c;Good morning, Franklin.&#x201d;<br><br>SAM&#x2019;s job was pretty much to follow her around everywhere. Liberty liked him a lot. Franklin did too, because SAM had discovered exactly the right way to scritch him.<br><br>Franklin saw SAM and immediately plopped down on the ground and rolled over.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you excited about your first day of school?&#x201d; SAM asked Liberty, scritching Franklin&#x2019;s belly.<br><br>&#x201c;Mostly,&#x201d; Liberty said. And then she looked around, and lowered her voice. &#x201c;But first, we have a top secret mission.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Proceed with instructions, Rottweiler,&#x201d; he said quietly.<br><br>Rottweiler was Liberty&#x2019;s Secret Code Name. Okay, her real official Secret Service Code name was Ruffles. Ugh. So Liberty had created her own Secret Secret Code Name: Rottweiler. Much better.<br><br>&#x201c;Follow me,&#x201d; Liberty said. She headed to the private elevator and pressed the button to take her downstairs.<br><br>&#x201c;May I ask where we&#x2019;re going?&#x201d; SAM asked her.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, just, you know. Downstairs,&#x201d; Liberty said as the elevator door opened.<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; SAM said. &#x201c;Go ahead, Rottweiler. Go ahead, SCRAPS.&#x201d;<br><br>SCRAPS was Franklin&#x2019;s secret secret code name. Secret Canine Rover Assistant to the President. SCRAPS got into the elevator.<br><br>The elevator bumped down to the bottom level and Liberty skipped out and down the hallway.<br><br>Rottweiler had arrived at her secret location.<br><br>The chocolate shop.<br><br>Liberty closed her eyes and breathed in deep. Ah. Sweet, sweet smell of yum.<br><br>&#x201c;Ahem,&#x201d; SAM said. &#x201c;Before we step inside, do your parents know where you are?&#x201d;<br><br>Liberty opened her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;You know how I&#x2019;ve asked to come to the chocolate shop every day since we moved in last week?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; SAM said. &#x201c;Morning, noon, and night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, my mom said that I can only come here on special occasions,&#x201d; Liberty explained. &#x201c;And my dad just said it himself. He said, &#x2018;Liberty! Today is a special occasion.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; said SAM.<br><br>&#x201c;Special occasion equals chocolate occasion,&#x201d; Liberty said. &#x201c;But sorry, Franklin, you have to wait outside. Chocolate isn&#x2019;t safe for dogs. Poor you.&#x201d;<br><br>And Liberty walked into the chocolate shop. It was a small room with a long counter and lots of shelves. There was a chef wearing a tall white chef&#x2019;s hat and mixing up a big pot of chocolate.<br><br>The wonderful heaven that was the chocolate shop.<br><br>&#x201c;Good morning, Chocolate Chef of Awesome,&#x201d; Liberty said.<br><br>&#x201c;And good morning to you, Miss Liberty.&#x201d; The chef turned to her. &#x201c;Would you like to peek at today&#x2019;s creations?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Definitely!&#x201d; Liberty said.<br><br>Liberty went over to the counter and saw a tray full of chocolates. There were chocolate-themed snowflakes and snowmen and snow women.<br><br>&#x201c;Wow,&#x201d; Liberty breathed. &#x201c;Just wow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; said the chef. &#x201c;Today we have a winter theme at our lunch for honored guests. And now we also have an early honored guest. The First Daughter. What may we do for you?&#x201d;<br><br>Well, Liberty had been thinking that the perfect <i>new</i> First Day of School tradition would be . . . chocolate for breakfast! She could have chocolate snowflakes, pancakes with chocolate syrup, and chocolate snowmen and snow women for dessert.<br><br>Liberty was just about to share her great idea with the chef when her cell phone rang.<br><br>Liberty looked down and her cell to see who was calling her.<br><br><b>POTUS (DADDY)</b><br><br>POTUS.

For many centuries, international relations between Medieval Japan, Korea and China were carried out by means of the &#39;inseparable trinity&#39; of war, trade and piracy. Much has been written about the first two means of interaction. The third element, which combined the other two in a violent blend of free enterprise, is the subject of this original and exciting book. It is written by Stephen Turnbull, who has visited all three countries in search of the elusive pirates of the Far East.</p><p>Stephen Turnbull is recognized as one of the world&#39;s foremost military historians of the medieval and early modern periods. He first rose to prominence as a result of his 1977 book, The Samurai: A Military History.

He always tries to concentrate on the less familiar areas of military history, in particular such topics as Korea, Eastern Europe, the Baltic states and the Teutonic Knights. The author lives in Leeds, UK.<p>&#x201c;Turnbull takes readers on a journey through the centuries of the Asian pirate. Using a variety of photographs, maps and color plats illustrated by Richard Hook, readers are immersed into the exciting, yet dangerous life of the pirate.

The first to make the voyage may have been a Mrs. Hudson and her maid, Frances Webb, who went in 1617 as companions to an Armenian lady who had been born in India. (Frances had a love affair on the voyage, unwittingly setting the pattern for countless women who came after her.) Over the years, India drew a few women looking for work&#x2014;as milliners, perhaps, or governesses. And some women had a calling to be missionaries. Others simply went because they had been summoned back by their families after an education in Britain.<br><br>The great majority, however, went to India because their husbands were there or because they hoped to find husbands for themselves. (To keep them chaste for the marriage market, unmarried women traveled, until well into the twentieth century, under the care of chaperones, usually married women who were making the voyage anyway.) The &#x201c;fishing fleet,&#x201d; as it was known unkindly but accurately by the nineteenth century, arrived in India in the autumn at the start of the cold weather. One lady who came out in 1779 divided what she called &#x201c;the speculative ladies&#x201d; into old maids, &#x201c;of the shrivelled and dry description,&#x201d; and girls, &#x201c;educated merely to cover the surface of their mental deformity.&#x201d; The odds were that their fishing would meet success: throughout the period of British rule in India, European men outnumbered European women by about three to one.<br><br>Understandably, few British women had cared to come to the unsettled India of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries; and, what is more, the early charters of the East India Company pointedly forbade women on its posts. Its employees ignored that regulation as they did so many others. They took Indian mistresses; worse, from the point of view of the Company&#x2019;s staunch Protestant directors, they married Catholics, daughters or widows of the Portuguese. To save the souls of its men, the Company, for a time, played matchmaker. In the later part of the seventeenth century it shipped batches of young women from Britain to India. The cargo, divided into &#x201c;gentlewomen&#x201d; and &#x201c;others,&#x201d; were given one set of clothes each and were supported for a year&#x2014;quite long enough, it was thought, for them to find themselves husbands. Some did not; and the Company tried to deny that it had any obligation to look after them further. Most unfairly it also warned them to mind their morals: &#x201c;Whereas some of these women are grown scandalous to our nation, religion and Government interest,&#x201d; said a letter from London to the Deputy Governor of Bombay in 1675, &#x201c;we require you to give them fair warning that they do apply themselves to a more sober and Christian conversation.&#x201d; If that warning did not have the right effect, the women were to be fed on bread and water and shipped back to Britain. The experiment was not a happy one and it must have been with relief that the Company abandoned the practice in the eighteenth century. British women still traveled to India but they came individually.<br><br>The voyage was a dreadful one. The wooden sailing vessels, tiny by today&#x2019;s standards, were tossed about in every storm&#x2014;and the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean were famous for their storms. The passengers faced at best being thrown about in their cabins, at worst drowning. The Reverend Hobart Caunter recorded one such storm, which took place off the east coast of India in the 1830s. The weather began to turn foul early one morning. &#x201c;The only lady among us every now and then expressed her fears, when a sudden gust caused the vessel to lurch with an increased momentum, as if the billows were already commencing a fiercer conflict.&#x201d; By late afternoon, they were in the midst of a full-blown hurricane. The ship pitched violently and furniture was torn from its fastenings. More dangerously, a cannon got loose and threatened to batter a hole in the side. Even Caunter, a seasoned traveler, found the noise, coupled with the crashing of waves and the howling of the wind, &#x201c;painful in the extreme.&#x201d; Night came on and the storm increased in fury. As Caunter and the captain were in the main cabin, or cuddy, trying to carry on a conversation, &#x201c;suddenly, a heavy sea struck her astern, but happily on the quarter, and in an instant carried away the quarter-galley on that side, swamping the cabin into which the poor lady before spoken of had retired for the night. The force of the water was so great, that it dashed open the door of the cabin, and its fair occupant was borne head foremost into the cuddy, dripping like a mermaid, her hair hanging about her shoulders in thin strips, when she was rescued by the captain from further mischief. She was drenched to the skin.&#x201d;<br><br>At its shortest the voyage under sail took under two months; at its longest well over six. Sometimes the winds were so contrary on the west coast of Africa that the ships were blown off course almost to Brazil. The crew and passengers gasped with the heat; then, when they were rounding the Cape of Good Hope, they shivered in the cold. There was the danger of being dashed against the shore by a sudden shift in the winds. Those who survived often ended up in the great slave markets along the east coast of Africa. Occasionally the winds might fail altogether and the unhappy ship would sit becalmed for weeks on end.<br><br>Accommodations were cramped and dirty and often had to be shared with huge rats which scurried about, boldly eating any food that was left out and nibbling holes in clothing. Women who could afford it had cabins abovedecks. Otherwise they were housed below, in stuffy cubbyholes, often with walls made of canvas, where they had very little privacy. A bucket of salt water was the closest passengers got to a wash tub; another bucket made do for a toilet. Mrs. Sherwood, later famous as a writer of sentimental children&#x2019;s stories, accompanied her army officer husband out to India at the beginning of the nineteenth century; she had to sleep in a hammock strung above a cannon while filthy water from the bilges ran across the floor beneath.<br><br>Mrs. Eliza Fay, who lived in India in the late eighteenth century, endured the voyage several times. Fortunately she was a woman who faced difficulties (and she had many&#x2014;from imprisonment by an Indian ruler to her wastrel of a husband) in an optimistic spirit. Her letters to her sister are filled with cheerful gossip and appalling details of shipboard life. On one voyage back to England, she nearly suffocated. &#x201c;The port of my cabin being kept almost constantly shut, and the door opening into the steerage; I had neither light nor air but from a scuttle.&#x201d; On her first voyage the captain was &#x201c;overbearing and insolent&#x201d; and kept his passengers half starved. At meals, Mrs. Fay reported proudly, &#x201c;the longest arm fared best; and you cannot imagine what a good scrambler I am become.&#x201d;<br><br>When they could, women on the sailing ships escaped from their cabins to the fresh air of the deck, but that depended on both the weather and the mood of the captain. Many of the captains of the East Indiamen were quite charmingly eccentric on dry land; at sea they seemed half mad and one of their more common phobias was women. Ladies were often forced to take their meals in their cabins rather than in the cuddy because the gentlemen drank and swore so dreadfully. Mrs. Sherwood confided to her diary that &#x201c;those who have not been at sea can never conceive the hundredth part of the horrors of a long voyage to a female in a sailing vessel.&#x201d;<br><br>At the start of the voyage, there might be the luxury of fresh meat, because many ships carried cows and sheep on deck. Sooner or later, rations would get shorter, the preserved meat tougher and saltier. Water would turn the color of strong tea, with a foul smell and an even fouler taste. Minnie Blane, a happy, sheltered young middle- class girl from Bath, experienced all the unpleasantness of sailing ships when she traveled out to India in 1856 with her husband, an officer in the Indian Army. (They might have taken the shorter route overland via Egypt and enjoyed the relative comfort of steamships but her husband needed to save money.) Minnie, who was pregnant, was sick a good deal of the time and the meals she faced cannot have helped. For weeks on end, after they had rounded the Cape, the only meat was &#x201c;Pork, boiled, roasted, fried, chops, curry (with so much garlic in it, it is quite uneatable), and one leg of mutton, half raw.&#x201d; The butter was thick with salt and sugar had long since run out. Some food was quite rotten. &#x201c;I cannot tell you,&#x201d; wrote Minnie to her mother, &#x201c;how sick it made me one day, on cutting open a fig, to see three or four large white maggots lying comfortably inside!&#x201d; Cautious travelers often took a private stock of food and wine. Many women brought other little comforts along in a brave attempt to make their quarters bearable. They had their own folding chairs, washstands, linen, and even chintz curtains to hang across the door.<br><br>Soldiers&#x2019; wives had the worst time of all. The Army&#x2019;s own troopships were appalling&#x2014;leaking, dirty, and cramped&#x2014;and the transports it sometimes had to hire from private contractors were scarcely better. Since the usual class distinctions were rigidly observed at sea, officers&#x2019; ladies at least got cabins; &#x201c;wives of others ranks,&#x201d; as the Army described them, were belowdecks, often in a corner of the hold next to the horses. There they endured the voyage, sleeping, eating, and passing their days in a stench which got worse as the voyage dragged on. Unless they were working for an officer&#x2019;s wife, they had little opportunity of getting on deck.<br><br>The military authorities of the eighteenth and early nineteenth c...</p><h2>Suppression of the African Slave-Trade to the United States of America: 1638-1870 (African American)</h2><p>Comprehensive, well-documented 1896 classic draws upon a wealth of primary source materials to examine the South's plantation economy and its influence on the slave trade, the role of Northern merchants in financing the slave trade during the 19th century, and much else.<br></p><p>First published in 1896, this book remains the standard work on the efforts made in the United States, from 1638 to 1870, to limit and suppress the trade in slaves between Africa and America.An American civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, sociologist, historian, author, and editor.

Although there is scarce opportunity in the book&#39;s 242 pages to delve into the details of such pivotal events in early American history as Shay&#39;s Rebellion and the collapse of the Federalist Party, Adams does consistently manage to choose those details which best support his thesis that &#34;excessive&#34; taxation is a form of government tyranny. This leads to interesting interpretations of history such as his sympathetic description of the Reconstruction-era Ku Klux Klan as an underground resistance movement against federal tax collectors. Adams also provides a full litany of charges of present-day assaults on liberty by the IRS. There is throughout a certain sense of preaching to the choir, quite understandable given the subject matter. However, those who pick up the book not thoroughly convinced that taxes are at best a necessary evil might welcome more history and less rhetoric.Charles Adams, formerly a lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles, is an independent scholar and tax consultant with the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C., and the author of <i>For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization.</i> He lives in Buffalo, New York.</p><h2>PENANCE JERRY KENNEDY</h2><p>For low-life Boston lawyer Jerry Kennedy, everything&#39;s gone sour--his client Louis Schwartz is in jail; he&#39;s a prey of the IRS; and his wife is giving him the silent treatment</p><p></p><h2>The Soul of Celtic Spirituality: In the Lives of Its Saints</h2><p>In this fascinating and absorbing quest, Michael Mitton introduces readers to the Celtic love of wholeness as reflected in its stories, traditions, rituals, and in the lives of its saints.

Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Houghton Mifflin Harcourt paperbackISBN&nbsp;978-0-618-26030-0</p><h2>Elfangor&#39;s Journey (The Andalite Chronicles, No.1)</h2><p>Part of The Andalite Chronicles, No 1</p><p></p><h2>Pathfinder&#39;s War: An Extraordinary Tale of Surviving Over 100 Bomber Operations Against All Odds</h2><p>Ted Stocker lived a charmed life. Trained at RAF Halton as one of Trenchard&#x2019;s &#x2018;Brats&#x2019;, a posting to Boscombe Down saw him fly in both the prototype Stirling and Halifax just as war engulfed Europe for the second time. Qualifying as one of the RAF&#x2019;s first flight engineers, he flew operations in 1941/42 with 35 and 102 Squadrons, a contemporary of Leonard Cheshire, helping with the often hair-raising task of converting pilots from two to four engines. On his return to 35, he became a pathfinder and flight engineer leader, taking part in virtually every major air battle of the war. Awarded the DFC in 1943, he was posted to 7 and then 582 Squadrons, going on to complete more than 100 bombing operations , often as a master bomber, and flying with some of the pathfinder &#x2018;greats&#x2019;, including Don Bennett himself. Although his aircraft was frequently hit, and he survived a crash landing on only his second trip, Ted was never wounded. His achievements were recognized with the Distinguished Service Order, the only known DSO issued to a flight engineer during the war or since.

From the first day, the first moment you meet them, you're�</p><p>Captivated.</p><p>Captured.</p><p>Committed.</p><p>Convicted.</p><p>My very first crush was on an English teacher named Mr. Weatherspoon in the second grade. He was fresh out of college and looked so fresh (uh, young) that, after meeting him on parent-teacher conference night, my mother just knew she was on Candid Camera: She thought he was a student masquerading as a teacher. He just took her observation as a compliment and flashed that smile. Lord, that smile. He had what you would call a baby-grand grin. Whenever he flashed it, I would hear them ivories and ebonies being tickled (notice how most forget to mention those black keys). And I don't know what tune was being played, but whatever it was, it was hypnotic - just like him. He always came to class dressed down in a shirt, jacket, slacks, and tie, and his scent was an aftershave lotion called Blue Musk (yes, I had the gall to ask; there was a reporter in me at that age).</p><p>I looked forward to when he would hunch over my desk, give me one of those smiles, reach out with that big, brown hand, and crown me the winner of our weekly spelling bee by brushing my head and saying, "Outstanding, Mitchell. Just outstanding." And I earned that reward every week: I studied an extra hour each Thursday afternoon to ensure that I held on to my title. When he smiled at me, when he touched me�I don't know, that button was pressed. Yeah, it was an innocent gesture and in no way sexual, but it had the opposite effect: Those homohormones really kicked into gear. I didn't know at that age what it was I was feeling or why I was feeling the way I was, but I knew that I loved the feeling.</p><p>But I was fully aware of what I was feeling and why I was feeling it this time. And I was truly enjoying what those homohormones were doing to me. I was in a daze, a haze over Mr. Reid: I just stared into space in all my classes, daydreaming about him. And at night? My wet dreams were so wild that I found my pillow and sheet on the floor in the morning and my underwear soaked. In a sense I had my art teacher, Ms. Yearwood, to thank for that.

The years between the two world wars were the golden days of commuters when they were commissioned by the Vanderbilt, Stroh, and Kennedy families, but express cruisers first became popular in the 1880s when business men like J.

I&#x2019;ve performed tens of thousands of nutritional therapy consultations&#x2014;in both the private and corporate sectors&#x2014;over the past three decades and have managed to successfully solve a majority of the health care problems I&#x2019;ve been confronted with. Unfortunately, many of the patients that I&#x2019;ve counseled arrive at my doorstep only after the medical orthodoxy has given up on them. Sadly, my office is all too often &#x201c;the last stop.&#x201d;</p><p>They&#x2019;ve come to me seeking nutritional assistance for heart disease, type 2 diabetes, Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, irritable bowel syndrome, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder&#x2014;the list goes on. Not so surprisingly, many of them are overweight when I first see them. Rarely, if ever, have I put any of them on formal weight loss diets, yet, oddly enough, a vast majority of them lose the weight they need to, and manage to keep it off.</p><p>My commitment has always been to help patients attain and maintain vitality by teaching them to cultivate some modicum of holistic integrity, and to save a life whenever possible. I&#x2019;ve always operated under the assumption that if I can help people to achieve balance in body, mind, and spirit, I will have put them in the best position to heal what ails them. As far as dealing with patients who suffer from being overweight and from obesity, my philosophy and approach have always been exactly the same. To my way of thinking, these problems are the natural result of a lifestyle that&#x2019;s devoid of holism. The only real antidote for these afflictions is a commitment to conscious living and a dedication to cultivating balance in body, mind, and spirit. It will never be about calorie-counting diet fads. Truth be told, it&#x2019;s about holistic transformation&#x2014;optimal nutrition, emotional freedom, and spiritual sentience.</p><p>Meanwhile, as America gourmandizes on empty calories, amasses incalculable pounds, and sabotages its collective body, mind, and spirit, it becomes increasingly desperate for effectual solutions. And as it continues its desperate search for answers, it exposes its aggregate predilection for false promise and specious, push-button solutions that don&#x2019;t work. Moreover, there is some question as to which worriment is worse&#x2014;its addiction to food or its obsession with spurious solutions. There seems to be no end to America&#x2019;s &#x201c;purple pill&#x201d; mentality. We appear insistent on clinging to the notion that the next quick fix is &#x201c;the one.&#x201d; Meanwhile, the knaves are lined up at our door and, as always, they&#x2019;re all too willing to take advantage of our desperation and gullibility. We continue to exhibit a high tolerance for their spin, in spite of the fact that their sham solutions remain infinitely ineffectual.</p><p>The cold, hard truth is if we&#x2019;re ever to resolve this dreadful dilemma, we must first be willing to dig down deeper. The diet du jour cannot solve this problem. We&#x2019;re not gaining weight simply because we&#x2019;re eating too much. We&#x2019;re eating too much because we&#x2019;re broken. We&#x2019;ve become so averse to feeling the pain at the root of our &#x201c;dis-ease&#x201d; that we&#x2019;re now driven to distraction with food. Weight loss dieting alone cannot get to the bottom of this problem. If our failed history of dieting tells us anything about solving this problem, it&#x2019;s that it is time for us to stop &#x201c;mowing the weeds.&#x201d;</p><p>Our current pandemic weight problem is representative of a disease that&#x2019;s causally rooted in dis-ease. Anything short of a wholehearted commitment to heal ourselves in body, mind, and spirit will merely result in more failure, and the only thing that we&#x2019;ll lose is more money.</p><p>The Whole Health Diet is the antidieting diet plan. It&#x2019;s very much about state-of-the-art, optimal nutrition, but it&#x2019;s also about arriving at your ideal weight as the natural result of attaining and maintaining your holistic balance. The WHD escorts the reader through a profound shift in consciousness. By adroitly making the connection between weight and metabolism, emotion, nutrition, physiology, brain (mind) neurology, and spirituality, the WHD provides the reader with the details of &#x201c;how to&#x201d; attain true holistic balance and wellness. I believe that by doing so, it&#x2019;s providing the only real solution to the problem of overweight/obesity.</p></p><h2>The Potato Book</h2><p>Hardcover with glossy dust jacket.1973 95p. 8.25x8.25x0.70.

Spada has written serious bios of Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Peter Lawford, and many others. Davis's two earliest shaping forces were her attorney father Harlan--a ``cold vacuum'' who thought she had little to offer, which maddened the mercurial Bette--and her mother Ruthie, who quickly divorced Harlan and guided her sometimes raging daughter toward the stage. Though they had wall-shaking rows, Ruthie bathed Bette nightly until well into her teens. Davis worked her way up through regional theaters, being directed by George Cukor in Rochester, early landed Broadway leads and a summons by Warner Brothers. Marriage to early beau Harmon Nelson, an orchestra leader, flopped as her career boomed; ``Ham'' (Harmon) talked her into two abortions. Her fury as the vile Mildred in Of Human Bondage made screen history as she became filmdom's first leading actress ever to set out to be absolutely revolting--audiences cheered when she died. Her first Oscar came a year later for the alcoholic lead in Dangerous, as did her first of many extramarital affairs--with her leading man, Franchot Tone, then engaged to Joan Crawford, with whom Bette feuded right up through their roles as sisters in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? When Ham records her bedroom noises with Howard Hughes, Spada calls the recording both a disc and a tape--and weakens the reader's faith. The rest of his dirt--more abortions, adultery, alcoholism, rage, husband Gary Merrill strangling her and beating their horse with barbed wire, the split with daughter B.D.--if not fresh, adds pungency. Familiar, and the acting gets slighted, but Davis gives fiery focus. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>While Bette Davis's fans in the 1930s thought of her as "a bedrock of Christian values," off-camera the willful, temperamental actress experienced abortion, adultery and sexual blackmail. In the 1950s Davis (1908-1989) and fourth husband Gary Merrill publicly presented a picture of domestic bliss, but Spada's irresistible, revelatory biography depicts the actress as an emotional wreck who drank heavily, unleashed anger and vitriol on her two daughters, staged mock suicide attempts and goaded her husband into violent quarrels. Beneath the grande dame image of the later years, we meet a sad, lonely, confused woman who had dalliances with young homosexual men whom she deluded herself into believing were her "suitors." Based on more than 150 interviews with friends, family and co-workers, this poignant bio bursts with film lore, gossip, countless affairs and family secrets. Spada, biographer of Peter Lawford and Grace Kelly, presents evidence suggesting that Davis accidentally pushed her alcoholic second husband Arthur Farnsworth to his death, then covered up the incident at the inquest. He limns a great actress while exposing the cruel, sadistic side of a woman "frantic with insecurity."

Bury's history is indispensable to anyone who seeks to understand the connection between the barbarian migrations of the third to the ninth century and the framework of modern Europe.</p><p>German and Roman legal systems had existed side by side. Professor bury shows how this worked and explains why Romans suffered more under the Lombards, who enforced Lombard law in Italy, than under previous invaders.J. B. Bury taught history for many years at the University of Cambridge.</p><h2>The Count and the Confession: A True Mystery</h2><p>Do you believe that the gentlest and<br>most courteous person you know<br>is capable of murder?<br>The count in John Taylor&#x2019;s beguiling true story is Roger de la Burde, a wealthy scientist and art collector, who wore ascots, claimed he was a Polish nobleman, bowed to women&#x2014;and then routinely propositioned them. In 1992, Burde was found dead on his Virginia estate, with a single bullet wound in his forehead. The Count and the Confession explores the layers of mystery surrounding this strange man&#x2019;s death. Did he, as the local deputies at first assumed, commit suicide? Or had he, as a state police investigator later decided, been killed? And if so, by whom? The longtime girlfriend? The pregnant mistress? A cuckolded husband? A disgruntled business associate?<br>At the center of this mystery is Beverly Monroe, who becomes the lead suspect in Burde&#x2019;s death. Monroe is an improbable murderer. Burde&#x2019;s companion for twelve years&#x2014;he called her &#x201c;Mouse&#x201d;&#x2014;she is an unfailingly genteel Southern lady, affluent, highly educated, and a mother of three children&#x2014;and prior to her indictment, she had never even received a parking ticket. But Monroe did have an apparent motive. She was also the last person to see Burde alive. And in a controversial interview with an ingeniously manipulative state police investigator, she changed her initial story and said that she had been present when Burde killed himself.<br>Critically acclaimed author John Taylor&#x2019;s recon-struction of this riveting case is narrative nonfiction at its best. Meticulously reported, artfully written, rich in psychological complexity, Gothic detail, and dramatic suspense, The Count and the Confession will make you marvel at the peculiarities of human motivation and force you to grapple with an array of irresistible questions, the most dramatic being Did she or didn&#x2019;t she?</p><p>Praise for John Taylor<br><br>Falling<br><br>&#x201c;Elegantly literary . . .

Unraveling the vagaries of love, sexuality, jealousy, and death, Highsmith weaves a mystery both hilarious and astonishing, a classic fairy tale executed with a characteristic penchant for darkness. Published in paperback for the first time in America, <em>Small g</em> is at once an exorcism of Highsmith's literary demons and a revelatory capstone to a wholly remarkable career. It is a delightfully incantatory work that, in the tradition of Shakespeare's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, shows us how bizarre and unpredictable love can be.</p><p>Patricia Highsmith (1921&#x2013;1995) was the author of more than twenty novels, including Strangers on a Train, The Price of Salt,&nbsp;The Blunderer and The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as numerous short stories.The last novel by this still underappreciated author, published here nine years after Highsmith's death, is a sour, mostly inert comedy of manners. In Zurich, Rickie Markwalder mourns his younger lover, Peter Ritter, stabbed to death late one night six months earlier. Accompanied by his small dog, Lulu, Rickie haunts a local bar called Jakob's, identified in guidebooks with a "small g" (for gay), hanging out with acquaintances. The bar draws a mixed crowd, most of whom are in love with people they shouldn't be (a familiar Highsmith theme). Renate, a club-footed, middle-aged atelier owner and her young employee Luisa are other regulars. Homophobic to the point of caricature, Renate despised Peter (upon whom Luisa had a crush) and despises Rickie. When a handsome young man, Teddie, comes to the bar, she and an associate set out to wreck any relationship he might develop with either Rickie or Luisa, both of whom are attracted to him. When Rickie and Luisa realize what Renate is trying to do, they make their own plans to punish her in return. While the narrative never flags, at no point does it take off. There are flashes of the author's wit, but much of the writing captures surfaces and nothing more, and Highsmith's remarkable observational powers are muffled. Although most of the characters are well drawn, Renate is simply too much of an ogre to serve as either a realistic threat or a foil, and the story suffers accordingly. Overall, this is a disappointing final note by one of our more interesting writers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thanks to a series of generous donors and enlightened curators, notably Langdon Warner and Sherman Lee, Cleveland's Asian holdings are now among the finest in the West, yet they are among the least published. Consequently, this book of the museum's treasures is long overdue.<p> More than 100 objects have been selected. They are divided into three categories: China and Central Asia, India and Southeast Asia, and Japan and Korea, with each region introduced by a short but useful art-historical summary. A full page is devoted to an illustration of each object, with commentary reflecting the latest scholarship in the field given on the facing page. Cleveland has been lucky in the timing of its collecting: many of the Japanese objects acquired by Sherman Lee after World War II would not be allowed to leave Japan today. And the joyful Krishna lifting Mt. Govardhana (Cambodian, 6th century), one of the sculptural masterpieces of the world, has no counterpart outside Phnom Penh and could never be replaced (its lower portion was put together from fragments that had lain hidden in a Belgian garden for 40 years). The accession numbers of the objects--from a 15th-century Korean Amita triad, acquired in 1918, to recently discovered Chinese textiles that are revolutionizing the field--indicate a continuous history of discriminating collecting that is still maintained today. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p>This book showcases the finest works of Asian art in the permanent collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art, one of America's leading collectors of this category. Selected from 4,399 holdings in a variety of media, more than 100 pieces are highlighted in full-page color reproductions, all accompanied by one-page commentaries by current or former curators. The introductory essay recounts the vision and historic formation of the collections, established in 1913. Covering arts from not only traditionally well-represented countries such as China, Japan, India, and Korea but also from lesser-known ones like Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Nepal, Kashmir, and Tibet, this book encapsulates centuries of ritual, belief, legend, and cultural archetype, culminating in the self-definition of the Asian peoples. Intended for both general readers and scholars, this is recommended as an important addition to the Asian art collections of public and academic libraries.?Lucia S.

Besieged for two months by a rabble in arms, the British decided to break out of town. American spies discovered their plans, and on the night of June 16, 1775, a thousand rebels marched out onto Charlestown peninsula and began digging a redoubt (not on Bunker Hill, which they had been ordered to fortify, but on Breeds Hill, well within cannon shot of the British batteries and ships). At daybreak, HMS Lively began firing. It was the opening round of a battle that saw unbelievable heroism and tragic blunders on both sides (a battle that marked a point of no return for England and her colonies), the beginning of all-out war.<br></p><p>On the morning of June 17, 1775, British troops moved to secure the heights around Boston. Marching up an incline called Breed's Hill, they engaged a battered gathering of farmers and tradesmen who, the night before, had hastily constructed a defensive wall within range of the Royal Navy's artillery. Richard M. Ketchum tells the story of the ensuing fight in his breathtaking <i>Decisive Day: The Battle for Bunker Hill</i>.<p> Ketchum explores what made that bloody, but relatively small, action decisive by probing the deteriorating relationships between New England and Britain during the months before the battle. He forcefully argues that both the British and American commanders were still seeking ways to make peace even as the guns began to fire. After June 17, 1775, the Americans and the British could view each other only as enemies.</p><p> The author of two other books on the Revolutionary War (<i>Saratoga</i> and <i>The Winter Soldiers</i>), Ketchum has written an authoritative history of how Americans--especially the rank-and-file soldiers--won their nation through combat. In <i>Decisive Day</i> he argues that the remarkable transformation of American rebels into soldiers was a crucial, if intangible, episode within the battle. Indeed, as those tired and shell-shocked colonials waited on their ramparts for some of the most disciplined fighters in the world, they did not shoot haphazardly, but held their fire until they saw the whites of British eyes. <i>--James Highfill</i></p>Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Richard M.

Now you shall see what happens to those who would break the spell of mermaids!"</i> Deep down in the underwater kingdom, Princess Finnglas is in the deadly grip of an evil sea monster, and the mermaids have bewitched Niall. Pangur B�n, the white cat, is desperate. He must rescue them&#x2014;but how? Only Arthmael can do it. But who is Arthmael? And where is he? Can Pangur B�n find him in time?</p><p>These spellbinding Celtic fantasies, which follow the exploits of the white cat Pangur B�n, his friend Niall, and the Princess Finnglas, are classic tales of good and evil, magic and danger. They are the work of acclaimed author Fay Sampson, three&#x2013;time nominee for The Guardian Children&#x2019;s Fiction Prize.Reviewed with Fay Sampson's <i>Shape-Shifter</i>.<p>Gr. 5-8. Originally published in England in the 1980s, these paperbacks concern Pangur, a white cat from Wales, and his fantastic adventures with a monk named Niall and other inhabitants of a medieval Irish abbey. In <i>Pangur Ban</i>, the cat is sailing in stormy waters with Niall and Finglass, the vengeful princess whose brother has been accidentally slain by the monk. The three almost drown, but instead singing mermaids entrap Niall and a hideous monster threatens to devour Finglass. Pangur pursues a seemingly hopeless quest to find help that is powerful enough to save his friends. <i>Shape-Shifter</i> goes back in time to the cat's origins in a Welsh cave, where a trio of witches seek to make him a conduit for their evil deeds. Pursued by the witches, he finds refuge with Niall and his companions, who have recently come to bring their Christian faith to the Welsh. The shape-shifting scenes that follow, in which the kitten transforms into different animals, are reminiscent of young Arthur's transformation into various creatures in T. H. White's <i>The Sword in the Stone</i>. The classic "battle of good and evil" theme finds fresh interpretation in these adventures. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Carolina Garcia-Aguilera, herself a Cuban-born private investigator and M. B. A., makes sure that both books contain just the right seasoning of local color and personal moments in their strongly plotted stories. This one finds Lupe trying to clear a local jeweler in the death of a would-be assailant. As in her first outing, things soon become personal.A second foray into the world of Cuban Miami with p.i. Lupe Solano (Bloody Waters, 1996), this time working on an assignment from sometime lover Tommy McDonald. McDonald is the lawyer representing Alonso Arango Sr., owner of Optima Jewelers in Coral Gables, who admits to shooting would-be robber Gustavo Gaston six times as Gaston came at him with a knife in the store's back office. The knife, however, is nowhere to be found, and six shots seem excessive. McDonald's plea of self-defense for his client is in jeopardy, and Lupe is asked to do background research. The store employs three salespeople, a bookkeeper, and a part-time cleaner, all of who disclaim any knowledge of Gustavo Gaston. So, too, does Arango's family--his wife Isabel and three grown sons. Lupe has a personal stake in this case, having recovered a phone message from her dearest friend Margarita, a decorator working on the Arango residence, only after Margarita's fatal car accident, telling Lupe that she has information about the case. As it turns out, almost everyone involved has something to hide. Before the close, the body count has furiously escalated and Lupe has been tailed, threatened, kidnapped, and herself almost killed. She comes through with the goods, of course--fortified throughout by lots of fine food, good liquor, and an occasional bout of lovemaking. A free-spirited heroine, some wry humor, and an insider's look at an unfamiliar milieu are pluses here. But the chaotic plot, with its excess of paper-thin characters, may lose readers long before the finish.

Yet, it remains an enigma in the West, especially among those who mistake it either for a Greek version of Roman Catholicism or for an exotic mixture of Christianity and eastern religion. Many, however, are coming to recognize the Orthodox Church for what it is: a worldwide community of Christian disciples that has been faithful to the apostolic command, stand fast and hold the traditions which you were taught, whether by word or by our epistle (2 Thess 2.15). Consequently, growing numbers of people are finding their true home in the Church that has continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers (Acts 2.42).<br><br>Among these converts are dozens of contemporary philosophers. Some are accomplished, world-renowned, senior scholars. Others are junior scholars in the earliest stages of their careers. As a group, they belong neither to any particular philosophical school nor to any particular Orthodox jurisdiction. What they have in common is a desire to enter deeply into an authentic and loving communion with the Living God, with God s people, and ultimately with all of God s creation.<br><br>Turning East is a collection of autobiographical essays in which sixteen of these philosophers describe their personal journeys to the Orthodox Church, explain their reasons for becoming Orthodox Christians, and offer a sense of how their conversions have changed their lives.</p><p>CONTRIBUTORS:<br>Jeffrey Bishop ,David Bradshaw,Mark J.

All three communities-and the alliance of humans, elves, and dwarves-are threatened by the religious fanaticism of the Horsekin. Only the magic of Dallandra and Valandario and the might of the powerful dragons, Arzosah and Rori, can save the Northlands from conquest.</p><p>Katharine Kerr first became involved in the field of fantasy through role-playing games, becoming so intrigued that she began writing articles for gaming magazines, and for some time was a contributing editor to <i>Dragon</i> magazine. This interest soon led her into the field of fantasy writing, with her first Deverry novel, <i>Daggerspell</i>, appearing in 1986. Since then, she has written fourteen more Deverry novels, of which <i>The Silver Mage</i> is the latest, as well as other fantasy and science fiction novels. Her Deverry novels have hit the London <i>Times</i> and the Australian bestseller lists.With only one installment left in Kerr's popular Deverry cycle, this 14th novel set in her fantasy realm of Annwn sets the stage for a climactic finale that fans have been anticipating since 1986's <i>Daggerspell</i>. The collective future of the humans, elves, dwarves, dragons and other fantastical inhabitants of Deverry is in jeopardy. Savage Horsekin tribes escalate their bloody assaults on Northlands settlements in the name of their goddess, Alshandra. As apprentice wizard Neb struggles to come to grips with his past life as the powerful sorcerer Nevyn, the magical island of Haen Marn suddenly reappears from nowhere, and few can agree whether this bodes well or ill. With multiple simultaneous plot lines, many of them dealing with relationships in past incarnations, pacing and continuity wallow, and the ending is merely an arrangement of chess pieces for the complex endgame of the final volume (tentatively titled <i>The Silver Mage</i>). <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

You know, like for violins to come in as you're breaking up with somebody, or drums to thump when you're being chased down an alley? (OK, maybe that's just my life.) My lead character in The Great American Whatever is an aspiring filmmaker &#x2014; his dream is to be the next Spielberg or Tarantino &#x2014; so I thought it was only fitting that he'd punctuate his own "life soundtrack" with iconic songs from some of his favorite movies. Pop some popcorn and grab your earbuds. </strong></p> <ul> <li>The "Flying Theme" from E.T. - Probbbbably my #1 most-listened to song for writing inspiration. (I&#x2019;m biased, because my first novel included E.T. as an entire fangirl subplot, but I promise these horns will send you over the moon.)</li> <li>"Mrs. Robinson" from The Graduate - Filmmaker icon Mike Nichols famously rejected Paul Simon&#x2019;s first two song efforts for the &#x201c;Graduate&#x201d; soundtrack, but three&#x2019;s a charm with the first rock song ever to win a Grammy for Record of the Year. </li> <li>"As Time Goes By" from Casablanca - &#x201c;Nostalgia: the song,&#x201d; basically. In &#x201c;The Great American Whatever&#x201d; Quinn looks back on his young life a lot, wondering how things could have gone differently. &#x201c;As Time Goes By&#x201d; is a sweet-sounding, slightly-sad song that Quinn would like, because he&#x2019;s 17, and being 17 is all about sweetness and sadness. </li> <li>"Everybody's Talkin" from Midnight Cowboy - This tune basically plays every time a young Jon &#x201c;Angelina Jolie&#x2019;s Dad&#x201d; Voight enters a new scene in this movie, which makes me wish I had my own theme song for every time I visit the fridge during a writing session.</li> <li>"Unchained Melody" from Ghost - Never has wet clay seemed so dirty. Leave it to a movie about a hot dead guy to bring this old Righteous Brothers song roaring back to haunt modern audiences. FYI if you don&#x2019;t cry you&#x2019;re a ghost.</li> <li>"Goldfinger" from Goldfinger - Long is the legacy of a new James Bond theme song topping the charts, but it&#x2019;s Shirley Bassey&#x2019;s camp classic &#x201c;Goldfinger&#x201d; that leaves me shaken AND stirred. </li> <li>"Rainbow Connection" from The Muppet Movie - First of all, Kermit, ARE there &#x201c;so many songs about rainbows&#x201d;? Second of all, I forgive you because I&#x2019;m SOBBING.</li> <li>"9 to 5" from 9 to 5 - The only country singer with her own theme park, Dolly Parton knows a thing or two about putting in a days&#x2019; work. Blast this one in your corporate cubicle.</li> <li>"Over the Rainbow" from The Wizard of Oz - The next time you&#x2019;re full of doubt, just keep in mind that MGM wanted to cut &#x201c;Over the Rainbow&#x201d; from the song for fear it would go over the head of little ones, and I don&#x2019;t mean munchkins. </li> <li>"Let the River Run" from Working Girl - My favorite pop/choral mashup by none other than the daughter of Richard L. Simon: one half of Simon &amp; Schuster, who publishes my books! (OK, &#x201c;Simon&#x2019;s daughter&#x201d; is also known as Carly Simon.)

From the very beginnings of his private practice, Jung had a disproportionately large number of women patients.

In War, noted military historian Gwynne Dyer ranges from the tumbling walls of Jericho to the modern advent of total war in which no one is exempt from the horrors of armed conflict. He shows how the martial instinct has evolved over the human generations and among our close primate relations, such as the chimpanzee. Dyer squarely confronts the reality of war, and the threat of nuclear weapons, but does not despair that war is our eternal legacy. He likes and respects soldiers, even while he knows their job is to kill; he understands the physics and the psychology of battles, but he is no war junkie. Dyer surveys the fiery battlefields of human history, never losing sight of the people caught up in war. He actually believes there is hope that war can be abolished, that human beings are more than just our genes. War is an award-winning book that explores the human past to imagine a different future.</p><p>GWYNNE DYER served in the Canadian, British, and American navies. He earned a Ph.D. in military history from the University of London, and was a senior lecturer in war studies at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. The original version of this book, published in 1985, won a Columbia University School of Journalism Award. A seven-part television series based upon War was broadcast in forty-five countries in the mid-1980s; one of the episodes was nominated for an Academy Award. Dyer writes a twice-weekly newspaper column on international affairs and security policy that is published by 175 newspapers worldwide, many in the U. S. He lives in London with his wife and children.A chronicle of organized human aggression gets a timely update in this new edition of a seminal book originally published 20 years ago. As Dyer covers the history of human warfare-from primitive tribal skirmishes and the "total war" of WWI and II to the imbroglios of the past 30 years (including the current one in Iraq)-a sense of cyclical inexorability begins to creep in, of history repeating itself again and again. One is struck by the notion that the only changes in the historical narrative of humans at war are new strategies necessitated by new, and exponentially more deadly, technologies. Implicit in Dyer's argument is the idea that, in war, humans have become increasingly subjugated to the increasingly awesome power of their machines, so that the nuclear stalemate of the Cold War becomes a logical extension of the deadlock of WWI trench warfare. Dyer is an accomplished military historian who bolsters his extensive knowledge with a rhetorical style that is at once invisible and entirely convincing. Structurally, the book accordions in and out from the psychology of individual soldiers, to the workings of whole armies, to broader historical movements and how they change (and stay the same) through time. It is a powerful effect, and one that ultimately makes this book at once a valuable historical treatise and a fervent and compelling call toward pacifism. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the same time, she left a body of work marked by intelligent, commanding writing that displays a singular wit and keen appreciation for the absurd. <i>Never Breathe a Word</i> calls attention to Blackwood's mastery, presenting a series of acclaimed short stories, both fictional and autobiographical. Selections span the entirety of her career, from her first book, <i>For All That I Found There</i>, to <i>Good Night Sweet Ladies</i>, one of her last before her death at age 64. The pieces of fiction alternate between tragic and artfully mundane, yet always share Blackwood's characteristic frankness and black humor. Three previously unpublished stories are included, featuring some of her most sympathetic heroines. Her nonfiction comprises eight evocative vignettes taken directly from her own life and set in narrative form. Beautiful, brazen, and living in "grand squalor" among ashtrays and empty liquor bottles, Blackood died in 1996 in Manhattan's Mayfair Hotel. She left behind a rare literary legacy&#x2014;one that testifies to our shared struggles, and to the threadbare connection between art and life.</p><p>Starred Review. A selection of grimly compelling fiction and journalistic pieces by Blackwood (1931&#x2013;1996), the Irish-born author and wife to Lucian Freud and Robert Lowell, spotlights her sharp-edged observations. Blackwood frequently excoriates her characters, starting with the painter's widow of The Interview, who holds forth with a young journalist and reveals nasty details of her marriage. Many of the characters are outsized meanies: the greedy, tyrannical nanny in The Baby Nurse takes over a family's London flat when the new baby arrives and the new mother sinks into a severe postpartum depression; while in Taft's Wife, a social worker endures an excruciating, drunken lunch with a prosperous, depraved mother and the 14-year-old son she once put up for adoption. Shocking, too, is the owner of a beauty parlor in Who Needs It? who sacks a new hire because the concentration camp numbers tattooed on her arm dampen the lighthearted mood of her salon. A handful of nonfiction pieces explore the author's childhood and the bourgeois fantasy of the Beatniks to round out this accomplished oeuvre by an author who should be better known in the States. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The veiled widow of a famous artist in &#x201c;The Interview,&#x201d; the tour de force that launches this galvanizing collection, is at once magnificent and monstrous during a disastrous interview with a humorless, priggish young journalist. The escalation of their verbal fencing match, the accretion of alarming details, the rising bizarreness, and the deepening anguish are Poe-like, while the caustic wit recalls that of Dorothy Parker. And throughout, one can&#x2019;t help but appreciate Blackwood&#x2019;s wry twisting of autobiographical details. As portrayed by Nancy Schoenberger in Dangerous Muse (2001), Blackwood (1931&#x2013;96), a beautiful Irish aristocrat and Guinness heir, counted among her husbands poet Robert Lowell and painter Lucian Freud, and was infamous for her wildness. And what fuming, self-destructing women she portrays in her acid stories: a doggedly cheerful beauty-shop owner undone by a dignified Holocaust survivor; a scorned wife on a demonic shopping spree. Blackwood&#x2019;s devastating fiction is followed by a selection of quirky, deft, and diabolical personal essays that suggest the impetus for her unflinching scrutiny of the dark side. Let this collection spark a Blackwood revival. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>The Seventy Great Mysteries of the Ancient World: Unlocking the Secrets of Past Civilizations</h2><p>Some of the ancient world&#39;s most enigmatic and fascinating mysteries are introduced here in an entertaining mixture of informative text by specialists and colour photographs, maps and diagrams.

With danger a constant companion - outwitting alligators, jaguars, pit vipers and electric eels, not to mention overcoming the hurdles of injuries and relentless tropical storms - Ed&#39;s journey demanded extreme physical and mental strength. Often warned by natives that he would die, Ed even found himself pursued by machete-wielding tribesmen and detained for murder. However, Ed&#39;s journey was an adventure with a purpose: to help raise people&#39;s awareness of environmental issues. Ed had unprecedented access to indigenous communities and witnessed the devastating effects of the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest first-hand.

Plants were his life-form of choice, and Dine immersed himself in the art of close observation. The results are not rigorous documentation, but rather drawings and paintings charged with energy and palpable vitality, the shimmer of light and shadow, and even the movement of Dine himself as he looks intently from plant to paper and back again. Each picture is a quest, and Dine's effort is obvious in his lines, brush strokes, and eager mix of media. In one recent piece he used charcoal, colored pencil, watercolor, gouache, enamel, and oil. Most of the works included here have never before been published, reason enough to acquire this volume, but curator Livingston's essay is also well worth reading. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Voluntary Simplicity: Toward a Way of Life That Is Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich (Revised edition)</h2><p><p> When <em>Voluntary Simplicity</em> was first published in 1981, it quickly became recognized as a powerful and visionary work in the emerging dialogue over sustainable ways of living. Now, more than ten years later and with many of the planet's environmental stresses having become more urgent than ever, Duane Elgin has revised and updated his revolutionary book.</p><p><em>Voluntary Simplicity</em> is not a book about living in poverty; it is a book about living with balance. It illuminates the pattern of changes that an increasing number of Americans are making in their everyday lives -- adjustments in day-to-day living that are an active, positive response to the complex dilemmas of our time. By embracing, either partially or totally, the tenets of voluntary simplicity -- frugal consumption, ecological awareness, and personal growth -- people can change their lives. And in the process, they have the power to change the world. First published in 1981, <em>Voluntary Simplicity</em> was instantly recognized as a visionary work. The <em>New York Times</em> called it "seminal"; the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> noted that it was "considered the movement's Bible." Revised in 1993 to address the trend toward downshifting, this pertinent book helps us to adjust our thoughts, habits, and goals and embrace the key elements of simplicity: frugal consumption, ecological awareness and personal growth.</p><p></p></p><p><i>Voluntary Simplicity</i> by Duane Elgin, first published in 1981 and revised in 1993, is the sacred text for those wanting to liberate themselves from enslavement to a job and the pursuit of status symbols. Elgin's work emerges from a concern for the environmental consequences of our mass consumption lifestyles. His book exhorts us to save the planet and our souls by "living with balance in order to find a life of greater purpose."A passionate and wide-ranging book that demonstrates the elegance of simplicity . . . It is a manifesto for the only kind of future that promises sanity and the possibility of contentment. Bread and wine for the spirit. Sam Keen, author of Fire in the Belly. <p>A copy of this book in every American household could change the course of history. . . .Voluntary Simplicity shows that what this nation needs is not so much a change of policy as a change of mind, and that individual citizens, acting on their own, can do more to solve our crisis than can any national administration.

The New York Review of Books<br><br>In 1948, as civil war ravaged Greece, children were abducted and sent to communist "camps" behind the Iron Curtain. Eleni Gatzoyiannis, 41, defied the traditions of her small village and the terror of the communist insurgents to arrange for the escape of her three daughters and her son, Nicola. For that act, she was imprisoned, tortured, and executed in cold blood. Nicholas Gage joined his father in Massachusetts at the age of nine and grew up to be a top investigative reporter for the New York Times.

Among her novels are the popular courtroom thrillers featuring attorney Barbara Holloway. Her other works include the science fiction classic <i>Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang</i>. Born in Ohio, she now lives in Eugene, Oregon.</p>Here's one of those special novels in which the narrator and author are clearly in sync. Todd Fielding, a newlywed who has just moved to Brindle, Oregon, quickly discovers that there are dark secrets enveloping the community. Anna Fields's reading is an ideal complement to the book. Fields has a strong, sometimes deep voice that meshes well with the story, especially during the scenes in which Fielding searches for the murderer who has taken the lives of many young girls. When narrating other books, Fields's voice has at times seemed too deep or not deep enough for key characters. But in this one, her style fits, resulting in a captivating performance.

She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime. Her books have sold over a billion copies in the English language and another billion in over 100 foreign languages. She is the author of 80 crime novels and short story collections, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.Special kudos to the voice casting executive at Audio Editions for this project! Horror screen icon Christopher Lee, thrust suddenly into the spotlight again in his 80s, thanks to his stint in LORD OF THE RINGS, steps up to the mike and delivers a vocal masterpiece. Lee embodies blue bloods and cockneys alike with equal aplomb, burnishing Christie's mysteries to a high and satisfying finish. The material is perfectly chosen as well--strong, tight mysteries with three-dimensional characters, particularly the title story with its sophisticated, Sherlock Holmes-ish surprise ending.

Westen Chan was just eight years old when his Caucasian mother died and his father, Xin, sent him away to be raised by her relatives. <br><br>Twenty years later, after a lifetime of estrangement, Westen receives an invitation from his father to travel with him to China&#x2014;a prom-ise Xin once made when Westen was a child. So it is that two strangers&#x2014;a father and a son&#x2014;travel halfway around the world to a land that one of them knows intimately and the other has never seen. As they tour the country, the two men reveal themselves slowly and awkwardly: Westen&#x2019;s history of failed relationships and his conflicted cultural identity; Xin&#x2019;s regret at leaving his son and the terrible secret he&#x2019;s kept too long. And in the end, their relationship may just hinge on the contents of a sealed letter written by Westen&#x2019;s mother before her death&#x2014;one that threatens to answer the lifelong question neither of them has dared to ask. <br><br>Powerful, moving, and beautiful, <i>Lost Men</i> is a stunning literary novel that explores cultural and ethnic identity, the meaning of family, the exigencies of fate, and the lengths to which we will go to reconnect with those we fear we have lost. Brian Leung reveals both the intimate hearts of his characters and the telling details of place with equal and substantial grace.</p><p>BRIAN LEUNG is the author of World Famous Love Acts, winner of the Asian American Literary Award and the Mary McCarthy Prize in Short Fiction. He was born and raised in San Diego County, and currently lives in Louisville, Kentucky, where he is an assistant professor of creative writing at the University of Louisville.The Age of Regret, years ago, far away from the now. Westen Chan has not seen his father for months, will not see him for decades. He is still not used to being around his great-uncle Cane. The two of them sit in the cab of the idling pickup. His uncle pats him hard on the head. "Your aunt Catherine thinks this is a good idea." She has sent them off to meet the only other Chinese in the county so Westen will know he isn't alone.<br><br>The pair step out of the truck. Westen is small, even for eight. He is dark-haired and olive-skinned; people guess that he's a mix, perhaps even Spanish or Black Irish, but never Chinese. His uncle Cane is tall with heaped shoulders, a lumbering walk, and a bristly head of white hair. His face and arms are pink and splotchy from too many years of sun.<br><br>Westen and his uncle walk between long, tin-sided buildings, the clucking hum of chickens sifting over them. It is the egg ranch of Parker Cheung. The late morning is damp, misty, and the pair head toward the covered loading dock where Parker and other men are stacking egg flats on racks. Parker's face is obscured by the bill of his sweat-stained cap, but when he turns to say hello, he reveals his Chinese face, the broad roundness of it anchored by a wide but compressed nose. Westen is both cautious and pleased to see a Chinese, someone who shares the features of his father.<br><br>"Cheung," Westen's uncle says.<br><br>"Cane," Parker returns, lifting his cap to wipe a plaid sleeve across his brow.<br><br>"This little fella is my great-nephew Westen. What do you think about that?"<br><br>Parker reaches out his hand, and Westen steps forward, returning a hopeful smile while taking the man's palm. He is surprised at how rough it is, and then, in an instant, is taken back by the sourness of Parker's odor. He lets go of the man's hand and stands again next to his uncle.<br><br>"What can I do you for?"<br><br>"Catherine thought we ought to come by and see if you might give Westen a tour of your operation."<br><br>"If you like eggs and chicken shit, I've got plenty to show you."<br><br>The two men shake with laughter, but Westen remains still. This man is not like his father at all. Not like any Chinese he's ever met. This man, in fact, is exactly like his uncle Cane. Suddenly there is a woman's voice, and the three turn toward a house not too far off, a gray vacancy of smoke rising from its chimney. "Pak. Pak," the woman calls. She is leaning out of the window, and Westen notices she is Chinese too. "Bring me dead chicken," she yells.<br><br>Parker looks at Westen and his uncle. "You two want to stay for lunch?" While the men laugh again, Westen thinks he definitely does not want to eat here. Holding up a cracked index finger bent slightly above the last knuckle as if broken years ago, Parker continues. "Give me a minute," he says, stepping away and into one of the chicken houses. The ranch is busy with other men walking between the buildings; it gurgles with the sound of hundreds of hens, then a roused clucking that Westen recognizes as the sound of fear. A dull thwack stills the clamor and Parker returns holding a white, beheaded chicken by its feet. It hangs at his side oozing a beaded drool of blood, which drips to the dark ground like glowing red candle wax.<br><br>"Say," Parker begins, extending the chicken toward Westen, "how about running this up to the wife, little man?" The bird smells and doesn't look nearly as white close up. Westen checks his uncle for direction because he does not want to touch this dead thing.<br><br>"Go about it," his uncle says. "Cheung and me got a meeting with Mr. Daniels for a few minutes."<br><br>Parker offers a conspiratorial chuckle. "It's Mr. Beam that's waiting on us." He looks at Westen. "Just carry it on up to the wife and tell her I promised you a cookie." Westen takes the chicken by its leathery feet, holding it as far away from his body as possible.<br><br>"Go on now," his uncle prods. "And best not to tell Mrs. Cheung about the meeting." He winks at Parker and the pair head inside the egg building.<br><br>Alone, Westen is aware of the sound of water falling. He looks up the hill where he is to deliver the chicken. The white house stares back at him from two red-curtained windows. To one side, half a football field away and through a stand of pine, he spots the wide lip of a waterfall, the dimension revealing itself as an unbroken expanse. The constancy of sound is nearly overwhelming. In front of this wall of falling water a thick, dark bridge extends itself, dead-ending at a cliff. The scene gives him the odd sensation of being distant and present all at once. A person in blue, a woman he guesses, sits on the railing, dangling her feet over the side. Her body gestures forward and back, clearly at ease with the precarious height. Westen has the impulse to call out to tell her to be careful, but she is much too far away to hear him.<br><br>Once at the house, Westen stands in front of the door thinking he might just drop the chicken and run. Before he can make a decision the door swings open. Inside, a plump woman with dyed hair and narrow black eyes brings her hand to her face in mock surprise. She is the one who called down to Parker for the chicken. "Your auntie say you come today," she offers without introduction, looking Westen up and down, nodding while she takes the bird. "Okay. I guess you Quang Dong Wa?"<br><br>Westen grins. He knows the meaning. "My father is."<br><br>"No. Say you Cantonese."<br><br>Sensing this is not a rhetorical command, he complies and accepts Mrs. Cheung's invitation to enter the house. She is the kind of Chinese he remembers, her assertive manner and broken English acting as a temporary balm, though he wonders how it's possible she and Parker are married. The house is surprisingly bright, filled with books and chicken-shaped knickknacks of all sorts. Westen and Mrs. Cheung pass a sliding glass door offering a view through the trees of the bridge and waterfall.<br><br>"You sit here," Mrs. Cheung says as they reach the kitchen. She taps a chrome chair with yellow vinyl upholstery that matches the Formica tabletop. The chicken is flopped into the sink. "I clean outside in a minute." She sits opposite Westen, hands folded in front of her, embroidered orange maple leaves on her sweater vest, each surrounded by small beveled rhinestones that could be rain or sunlight breaking through a fall canopy. "Your auntie ask me talk to you. Why you not a happy boy?"<br><br>"I'm happy," Westen says, but he knows there is no conviction in it.<br><br>Mrs. Cheung places her hands flat on the table and stands. "Wait," she says, exiting the kitchen. When she returns she is holding a pad of paper and a large red book with gold Chinese lettering. She asks Westen a series of questions: his birth date, the time he was born, how to spell his first name. With each query she consults the book and writes on the pad of paper. Her work is certain and officious, as if she is interviewing a job applicant, her lips thinned in tight concentration. Westen watches her blunt fingers press the pencil, embedding dense Chinese characters into the paper. Mrs. Cheung makes a single nod with each notation. In a quiet moment when she is double-checking her work Westen watches a drop of water collect at the lip of the kitchen faucet until it relents to gravity. "Maybe I should go find Uncle Cane," he says when the drop falls.<br><br>Mrs. Cheung looks up from her pad. "They drinking. Don't worry. I take you home."<br><br>Westen knows he will not see his uncle for the rest of the day.<br><br>"You will visit China," Mrs. Cheung says, pointing to her math. "But I think you will be an unhappy boy and an unhappy man until then."<br><br>Westen cannot comprehend the forecast, but he makes an attempt. "China will make me happy?"<br><br>"No," she says emphatically. "Nothing make anyone happy. But I going to help." She reaches into her pocket and retrieves four items: a thin red ribbon, matches, a candle, and a palm-sized box covered in worn blue velvet. She ties the ribbon around the box, leaving a bow the size and shape of a small butterfly. "My mother give me before I come to U.S. I give you now."<br><br>There is something about this gesture that comforts Westen as he watches Mrs. Cheung light the candle and drip dense wax onto the knot of the bow. "My mother do this too. She tell me I'm unhappy girl after my father die." The pair sit quietly looking at this new red-winged creation sitting atop the blue box. "Now you open in China only at right moment," Mrs. Cheung continues. "Maybe you be happy. Before that, no good. You tell someone, no good. This only your box."<br><br>"When will this happen?"<br><br>"Wait for your father like I wait for Mr. Cheung," she says. "He come back. You put away until then. Be a good boy and remember to listen to your auntie. She love you."<br><br>Westen feels a flush of heat and hope at the prospect of his father's return, but he wonders just how long he is going to have to wait. Picking up Mrs. Cheung's box, he carefully feels its weight. "Is it magic?" he asks.<br><br>"No," Mrs. Cheung says firmly. "It hope."<br>1<br><br>The son receives a letter from his father; he considers his home and how to respond.<br><br>A letter from my father has arrived, and I don't want to open it. I found it with the other mail as I walked up my gravel drive looking through furniture ads, bills, and inquiries about my pigeons. Among these was an envelope in my father's handwriting, posted from Los Angeles. Part of me wants to put the letter back in the mailbox. He has written Westen Chan on the outside, a last name I haven't used since I was eight, when they changed it to Gray. ...</p><h2>Songwriting and the Creative Process: Suggestions and Starting Points for Songwriters</h2><p>Solid information and supplemental ideas useful to beginners and established writers alike, this book is a complete guide to developing songwriting skills from inception of the idea to completing the song.</p><p></p><h2>Unbound: Breaking Free of Life&#39;s Entanglements</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><b>Believe and trust in love again!</b>&nbsp;Unbound weaves an uplifting tale of two people who begin their journey held captive by the strongholds and thought patterns that had prevented them from loving each other, their families, and the Father.&nbsp;Their pain begins to outweigh their shame until they seek for help, finding healing for their lives, their family, and for literally thousands of people around the world.&nbsp;Share the true story of how Jack and Trisha Frost apply God&#x2019;s unconditional love to their lives and it forever changes them and their family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn to: �Understand why we experience pain in order to develop a character that causes us to live moral lives. �Become more than you can imagine you could ever be. �Uncover the old habit patterns of thinking, that have become strongholds in your life and alienate you from intimacy first with Him and then with those you love.Choose to take a chance to find your destiny through new challenges and discover what it means to live a life <b><i>unbound</i></b> from life&#x2019;s entanglements.<p></p><p> </p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Jack and Trisha experienced many things through their 35 year relationship; some joyful and exciting, others wounding and disappointing.

Nicholas Jenkins has been posted to a War Office liaison Section to work for the Allied forces. Absurdities coincide with horrors for the characters of A Dance to the Music of Time, especially in the shady secret services; and although the violence is off-stage, it is still catastrophic. Jenkins&#39;s friend and colleague, David Pennistone, talks in philosophic terms while making the best of being a soldier; the dazzling array of individual foreign officers encountered adapt themselves to life in exile, while the eminent figures of Finn, Farebrother -- and, naturally, Widmerpool -- have different ideas of how War should be waged.</p><p>Anthony Powell&#39;s work includes &#34;Miscellaneous Verdicts&#34; and &#34;Under Review,&#34; both available from the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;I think it is now becoming clear that <b>A Dance to the Music of Time</b> is going to become the greatest modern novel since Ulysses.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Clive James<br><br>&#x201c;I would rather read Mr Powell than any English novelist now writing.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kingsley Amis</p><h2>The Notebooks of Lazarus Long</h2><p>Too young to fight in the First World War, but destined to lead the first successful expedition to another star system, the (literally) immortal Lazarus Long is the most popular and enduring character created by Robert A. Heinlein, author of numerous New York Times best sellers. He starred in Heinlein&#39;s most popular novels, including Methuselah&#39;s Children, Time Enough For Love, The Number Of The Beast, To Sail Beyond The Sunset and others. The oldest living member of the human race due to his unique genes, Long has been a pioneer on eight planets, survived wars and lynch mobs, and explored most of the galaxy. His adventures have given him a breadth of experience distilled through the irony of an immortal viewpoint. But there is nothing pompous about Long&#39;s reflections on the human condition. As the noted editor and critic David G. Hartwell has observed, &#34;Lazarus&#34; comments are acute, lively and intelligent.&#34; And here they are, compiled in one beautifully designed trade paperback, filled with illuminations and illustrations by renowned Science Fiction artist Stephen Hickman, for the delight of the millions of Heinlein fans around the world.</p><p>&#34;Heinlein knows more about blending provocative scientific thinking with strong human stories than any dozen other contemporary science fiction writers.&#34;</p><h2>End Of The Affair</h2><p>The novelist Maurice Bendrix&#39;s love affair with his friend&#39;s wife, Sarah, had begun in London during the Blitz. One day, inexplicably and without warning, Sarah had broken off the relationship. Two years later, driven by obsessive jealously and grief, Bendrix sends Parkis, a private detective, to follow Sarah and find out the truth.</p><p>Set in London during and just after World War II, Graham Greene's <i>The End of the Affair</i> is a pathos-laden examination of a three-way collision between love of self, love of another, and love of God. The affair in question involves Maurice Bendrix, a solipsistic novelist, and a dutifully married woman, Sarah Miles. The lovers meet at a party thrown by Sarah's dreary civil-servant husband, and proceed to liberate each other from boredom and routine unhappiness. Reflecting on the ebullient beginnings of their romance, Bendrix recalls: "There was never any question in those days of who wanted whom--we were together in desire." Indeed, the affair goes on unchecked for several years until, during an afternoon tryst, Bendrix goes downstairs to look for intruders in his basement and a bomb falls on the building. Sarah rushes down to find him lying under a fallen door, and immediately makes a deal with God, whom she has never particularly cared for. "I love him and I'll do anything if you'll make him alive.... I'll give him up forever, only let him be alive with a chance.... People can love each other without seeing each other, can't they, they love You all their lives without seeing You." <p> Bendrix, as evidenced by his ability to tell the story, is not dead, merely unconscious, and so Sarah must keep her promise. She breaks off the relationship without giving a reason, leaving Bendrix mystified and angry. The only explanation he can think of is that she's left him for another man. It isn't until years later, when he hires a private detective to ascertain the truth, that he learns of her impassioned vow. Sarah herself comes to understand her move through a strange rationalization. Writing to God in her journal, she says: </p><blockquote> You willed our separation, but he [Bendrix] willed it too. He worked for it with his anger and his jealousy, and he worked for it with his love. For he gave me so much love, and I gave him so much love that soon there wasn't anything left, when we'd finished, but You. </blockquote> It's as though the pull toward faith were inevitable, if incomprehensible--perhaps as punishment for her sin of adultery. In her final years, Sarah's faith only deepens, even as she remains haunted by the bombing and the power of her own attraction to God. Set against the backdrop of a war-ravaged city, <i>The End of the Affair</i> is equally haunting as it lays forth the question of what constitutes love in troubling, unequivocal terms. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i>The love affair between Maurice Bendix and Sarah, flourishing in the turbulent times of the London Blitz, ends when she suddenly breaks it off. A chance meeting rekindles his love and jealousy two years later, and Bendix hires a private detective to follow Sarah. Slowly his love for her turns into an obsession. <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Art of the Modern Movie Poster: International Postwar Style and Design</h2><p>This is the ultimate book for poster fans and film buffs around the world.

That the carnage spoiled Christmas time is the slender irony anchoring this aimless retelling by military historian Weintraub (<i>Silent Night: The Story of the 1914 Christmas Truce</i>). Noting American complacency about the German buildup, and strategic and personal squabbles among the Allied commanders, he trumps up Patton's prayer for good killing weather into a dramatic turning point. Mainly, though, the book is a kaleidoscope of anecdotes, combat scenes alternating incoherently with foxhole doldrums and frontline picaresque. There's pluck and defiance&#x2014;" 'They've got us surrounded, the poor bastards,' " quips a jaunty GI&#x2014;and death and despair. There are celebrity cameos: correspondent Ernest Hemingway drinks and growls and shoots a few Germans; Marlene Dietrich, on a USO tour, allows a soldier to dust her body with delousing powder. And there are many Christmas celebrations, everywhere from POW camps and Belgian orphanages to Hitler's headquarters. Unfortunately, the reader gleans neither a clear battle narrative nor a sense of pathos&#x2014;only a period-authentic impatience to get the war over with. 8 pages of b&amp;w photos not seen by <i>PW</i>. <i>(Nov. 28)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

R. R. Tolkien, during World War I, Simon Tolkien delivers a perfectly rendered novel rife with class tension, period detail, and stirring action, ranging from the sharply divided society of northern England to the trenches of the Somme. </b><br><br>Adam Raine is a boy cursed by misfortune. His impoverished childhood in turn-of-the-century London comes to a sudden and tragic end when his mother is killed in a workers' protest march. His father, Daniel, is barely able to cope with the loss. But a job offer in the coal mining town of Scarsdale presents one last chance, so father and son head north. The relocation is hard on Adam: the local boys prove difficult to befriend, and he never quite fits in. Meanwhile tensions between the miners and their employer, Sir John Scarsdale, escalate, and finally explode with terrible consequences.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the aftermath, Adam's fate shifts once again, and he finds himself drawn into the opulent Scarsdale family home where he makes an enemy of Sir John's son, Brice, who subjects Adam to a succession of petty cruelties for daring to step above his station. However, Adam finds consolation in the company of Miriam, the local parson's beautiful daughter with whom he falls in love. When they become engaged and Adam wins a scholarship to Oxford, he starts to feel that his life is finally coming together&#x2014;until the outbreak of war threatens to tear everything apart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the slums of London to the riches of an Edwardian country house; from the hot, dark seams of a Yorkshire coal mine to the exposed terrors of the trenches in France; Adam's journey from boy to man is set against the backdrop of a society violently entering the modern world.</p><p>SIMON TOLKIEN was born in England in 1959 and grew up near Oxford. His grandfather was J. R. R. Tolkien. He studied modern history at Trinity College, Oxford, and then went on to become a lawyer specializing in criminal justice. His novels include <i>Final Witness</i>, <i>The Inheritance</i>, and <i>The King of Diamonds</i>. He lives with his wife and two children in Southern California.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>1900</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> The first world Adam knew was the street. It came to him through his senses without mental dilution, filling up his head with sounds and smells and images that he couldn&#x2019;t begin to unravel. Lying in bed at night with his eyes closed, he could see Punch and Judy bludgeoning each other with rolling pins, just as if they were right there in front of him. Down they went and up they came, again and again: gluttons for punishment. He knew that Benson, the rag-and- bone man with the blue scar across his chin, was pulling the strings behind the tattered red curtain, but that didn&#x2019;t make the garishly painted puppets any less real. Just thinking about them made him laugh until his insides hurt, in the same way that he laughed years later in the bioscope when he saw Charlie Chaplin with his bow legs and stick and black moustache, marching confidently up the road towards his next disaster.<br><br> For a long time there was no cinema in Islington where they lived. There didn&#x2019;t need to be&#x2014;the street was a complete world, turning on its axis to the sound of the waltzes that flew up on a thousand notes out of the brightly painted barrel organ as the bald- headed grinder methodically turned the handle, looking neither to right nor left. He was solemn and sad and apparently unconnected to everything around him, even his monkey, which had a blue cap on its head with a tassel that bobbed up and down as it jumped around with the collection box. Sometimes the children danced to the music, weaving around each other in elaborate patterns, watching their feet&nbsp;to keep clear of the leaking tar and the horse manure. Some of them had no shoes and the tar was hard to get off the skin. You had to use margarine and even that didn&#x2019;t always work.<br><br> The street was familiar and exotic all at the same time: a mael- strom of life. The muffin man carried his wares in a tray balanced on the top of his head; it swayed as he walked but it never fell. The fishmonger wheeled a barrow and, if he dared to look inside, the dead black eyes of the cod staring up out of the white-crystal ice made Adam shiver. And the flycatcher wore a tall black hat with long strips of sticky paper fastened to it, all covered with dead insects, calling out dolefully as he passed: &#x201c;Flies, flies, catch them alive!&#x201d;<br><br> On Saturday nights in summer Adam could look out of his bed- room window and see Baxter, the fat butcher in his bloodstained greasy white apron, standing in the doorway of his shop, lit up by the flare of a paraffin lamp, shouting out to the worse-for-wear men leaving the Cricketers&#x2019; Arms on the corner: &#x201c;Buy me leg, buy me leg.&#x201d; It was because the poor man couldn&#x2019;t afford to keep the meat cold overnight, Adam&#x2019;s father told him; by morning it would be good for nothing.<br><br> And once a month two bent-over old men came slowly up the street, pushing a small cart with long handles, from which they sold solid blocks of salt. &#x201c;Any salt please, lah-di?&#x201d; they asked in their sing- song foreign-sounding voices, holding up the white salt in their black fingerless gloves like an offering. Sometimes Adam&#x2019;s mother bought from them and sometimes she did not. It depended on whether there was any money in the house.<br><br> Adam&#x2019;s mother, Lilian, believed in God but Adam&#x2019;s father, Dan- iel Raine, did not. He believed in something else instead, called socialism, which Adam didn&#x2019;t understand until later, even though his father tried to explain it to him sometimes. Adam&#x2019;s mind wasn&#x2019;t yet ready for abstract concepts. God was different. He couldn&#x2019;t <i>see </i>God, of course, but he could feel his presence in the high fluted arches of the Holy Martyr Church with the soaring white spire that he went to with his mother on Sunday mornings. God&#x2014;as Adam pictured him&#x2014;had a huge head and a white snowy beard and he lived up above the grey London clouds, gazing down at his creation&nbsp;with big eagle eyes. He was surrounded by a throng of ancient saints who had slightly shorter beards and a lesser number of winged angels who did not. They were extra eyes in case God needed them.<br>&nbsp;<br>And God was not happy. In fact he was angry, filled with &#x201c;a righ- teous rage&#x201d; according to Father Paul, an old priest with red mottled cheeks and thick grey bushy eyebrows that met in a wiry tangle in the middle of his wrinkled forehead, who was the rector of the Holy Martyr. God was incensed not by the poverty and injustice that Adam&#x2019;s father complained about, but by the wickedness and debauchery, the unbridled lechery and fornication, that was going on day and night down below. Adam wasn&#x2019;t clear what these sins were but he knew they were bad, very bad. &#x201c;Repent; repent now before it is too late,&#x201d; the rector shouted at them all from the high, elabo- rately carved pulpit. Adam watched fascinated as beads of perspira- tion formed in the crevices of the old man&#x2019;s face and trickled down, dripping in globules on to his surplice. He sat very still, clutching his mother&#x2019;s hand, and wanted to urinate.<br><br> &#x201c;Will Daddy go to hellfire?&#x201d; he asked her as they crossed the park afterwards, going back home under a leaden November sky.<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; Lilian said. &#x201c;Definitely not. Your father is a good man.&#x201d; &#x201c;But he doesn&#x2019;t believe,&#x201d; said Adam. &#x201c;And Father Paul says that if you don&#x2019;t believe, you can&#x2019;t be saved. That&#x2019;s what he said. I heard him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus died for all of us,&#x201d; she said, squeezing her son&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;He loves us. You need to know that.&#x201d; And he was grateful to his mother for the reassurance, even though what she said didn&#x2019;t make much sense. Adam didn&#x2019;t like to think about Jesus if he could help it, bleeding to death on the big wooden cross, stuck up there under the hot sun in that horrible Golgotha place with all those Roman soldiers gawping at him; and he was secretly glad when his father said that the Bible was all lies, stories that the rich had made up to keep the poor in their place, doing the rich man&#x2019;s bidding.<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;The opium of the people&#x2019;: that&#x2019;s what Karl Marx called religion and he was absolutely right,&#x201d; Daniel Raine shouted at his wife across the kitchen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the promise of heaven to justify a hell while we&#x2019;re alive. The hell we&#x2019;re living in now,&#x201d; he added for good measure.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> When his father raised his voice, Adam was frightened and slipped down under the table where he could push the black-and- silver-painted train with real tiny wheels that his father had made for him up and down the patterned lines on the oilcloth-covered floor. They were like the web of railway tracks he had seen at King&#x2019;s Cross Station when his mother had taken him there in the summer to see the steam trains coming and going in all their smoky glory.<br> He could still see her from where he was, standing at the range, stirring a pot with a big wooden spoon. There were onions in the soup she was preparing; he could smell them, and perhaps that was why there were tears in her eyes. Adam didn&#x2019;t know and he would have liked to run to her and put his arms around her thin waist, encircling her in a tight embrace, but he knew instinctively that he had to stay where he was; that he couldn&#x2019;t stop the trouble because the argument was about more than God and the man called Marx that his father so admired. It was about his father being out of work again and there not being enough money to pay for what they needed to buy.<br><br> The next day two men in brown overalls came with a horse cart and took away the piano that stood in pride of place in the front room of their small house. They brought a paper and said it was by order because Adam&#x2019;s father hadn&#x2019;t kept up with the payments. Adam knew what &#x201c;by order&#x201d; meant. It meant there was nothing you could do; it was the same as if God had ordered it as a punishment because you had sinned. There was no right of appeal.<br><br> Lilian had played the instrument sometimes in the evening, her long beautiful fingers caressing the keys, gliding in a space of their own. Her music was different from the barrel-organ waltzes the hurdy-gurdy man played&#x2014;thinner and frailer and sadder, full of sweetness and loss, hinting at places far away that had vanished from the world. And Daniel would sit on an upright chair in the corner of the room, listening to his wife play with bowed head and folded hands, quite still; as though he was one of the devout worshippers in church on Sunday mornings, Adam thought, although he would never have dared say so.<br><br> Adam watched his father when the men came; watched the way&nbsp;his hands balled up into useless fists, rocking from side to side as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other and back again; and watched as he beat his head uselessly against the frame of the front door after they had gone.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; Lilian said, laying her hand gently on the back of her husband&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t need it, Daniel . . .&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But we do,&#x201d; he shouted, refusing to turn around. &#x201c;Life should be about more than grubbing around, trying to stay alive. We&#x2019;re not animals to be given just enough food and fuel to keep producing goods for the capitalists to sell until we get old and sick and are no more use to them any more. We&#x2019;re entitled to more than that; we must be.&#x201d;<br><br> It was as if he was asking a question but Lilian didn&#x2019;t have an answer, unless she told her husband to trust in the Lord, and she knew better than to do that. And he was wrong about the fuel. They had none, and that evening Daniel broke up the chairs and burnt them in the hearth. They ate bread and dripping in the light of the flames and later that night Adam heard his mother coughing on the other side of the thin wall, on and on into the small hours, making Adam&#x2019;s chest constrict in sympathy so he couldn&#x2019;t sleep and prayed instead to the big angry God in the clouds to give his father work.<br><br> God didn&#x2019;t answer at first. The building trade was always slow in winter and Daniel hadn&#x2019;t helped his prospects over the years by his largely fruitless efforts to persuade his fellow workers to stand up for themselves and join the union. What jobs there were came in dribs and drabs, and Adam&#x2019;s mother had to go out to work as a charwoman, bringing back scraps of meat to feed her family. &#x201c;Leav- ings from the rich man&#x2019;s table,&#x201d; Daniel called them in disgust, but the family missed them when Lilian fell ill, and he had to go and ask for help from the thin-lipped, tight-fisted relieving officer known to everyone on the street as &#x201c;Old Dry Bones.&#x201d;<br><br> Daniel came back furious. &#x201c;Told me that I should put my new suit on next time I came,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I told him that if I had a new suit I&#x2019;d pawn it to get what I need rather than coming cap in hand to the likes of him. Like going in front of a judge and jury it was.&#x201d;<br><br> Adam&#x2019;s Sunday clothes had long ago been pawned. To begin&nbsp;with, his mother would take them in on Monday morning and then queue up on Saturday night to redeem them for use the next day. And at church she told Adam not to kneel but just to sit on the edge of the bench and lean forward, as she was worried about him getting the trousers dirty. But when she got sick she stopped going to church and the pawn ticket stayed where it was, gathering dust on the front- room mantelpiece, across from the bare patch on the wall where the piano had once stood.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;God will understand,&#x201d; she told her son. But Adam wasn&#x2019;t sure she was right. He didn&#x2019;t miss his tight-fitting Sunday clothes or his visits to the church with the high arches, but he thought that their non-attendance would make God significantly less inclined to help his family in their hour of need.<br><br> That said it wasn&#x2019;t as if his father was being singled out for mis- fortune. Other families on the street were faring even worse. Some couldn&#x2019;t pay their rent and took off without warning, piling their belongings into over-laden donkey carts so that the bailiffs couldn&#x2019;t seize them when they came to levy distress. There was even a local barrow firm that advertised moves by moonlight. Friends that Adam made playing around the drinking fountain out in the street changed from day to day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> On Christmas Eve the gypsies set up a boxing ring in the mar- ketplace and a tall black-eyed Romany in a frock coat, with red lapels buttoned over a dirty lace cravat, offered five shillings to anyone foolish enough to challenge his heavy, muscled champion; double if you managed to last a three-minute round; and a sovereign if you knocked him down. The man in the frock coat held up the gold coin, twirling it between his finger and thumb so that it glinted in the winter sunlight, attracting the attention of the crowd.<br><br> The gypsy fighter sat waiting on a folding stool in the corner of the ring, which seemed barely able to hold his weight. He was stripped to the waist in defiance of the cold and behind him an old grey-haired woman with long silver hoop rings in her ears stood with her legs akimbo, massaging oil into his broad back.<br><br>&nbsp;<br> Adam was fascinated by the whole spectacle, although he didn&#x2019;t want to get too close. He remembered what the children sang on the street: &#x201c;Take the earrings from your ears and put them through your nose and the gypsies&#x2019;ll take you.&#x201d; But from where he was, standing up on his tiptoes, he could see the coloured tattoos on the big fight- er&#x2019;s biceps&#x2014;a snake that writhed and a girl whose chest expanded each time he flexed his muscles. Thick black curly hair sprouted up on the top of the champion&#x2019;s flat-shaped head, and his tiny eyes set back under a domed forehead seemed to be focused on nothing at all. Staring up at the gypsies, Adam only became aware of his father&#x2019;s decision to take the challenge when it was too late to try and stop him.<br><br> &#x201c;Hold these for me,&#x201d; Daniel said, handing Adam his shirt and jacket. &#x201c;And stay where you are. I&#x2019;ll be back in a minute, I promise,&#x201d; he added with a smile, seeing the look of panic on his son&#x2019;s face.<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do it, Dad. He&#x2019;ll knock you out,&#x201d; Adam shouted, but his father had already climbed up into the ring and the gypsy man in the frock coat was leading him forward to introduce him to the crowd.<br> &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, here&#x2019;s a brave volunteer. What&#x2019;s your name, mister?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Daniel.

It has little left to maintain its legacy of reason, freedom, human dignity and democracy. Far from capitulating, Jens Zimmermann believes the church has an opportunity to speak a surprising word into this postmodern situation grounded in the Incarnation itself that is proclaimed in Christian preaching and eucharistic celebration. To do so requires that we retrieve an ancient Christian humanism for our time. Only this will acknowledge and answer the general demand for a common humanity beyond religious, denominational and secular divides. <em>Incarnational Humanism</em> thus points the way forward by pointing backward. Rather than resorting to theological novelty, Zimmermann draws on the rich resources found in Scripture and in its theological interpreters ranging from Irenaeus and Augustine to de Lubac and Bonhoeffer. Zimmermann masterfully draws his comprehensive study together by proposing a distinctly evangelical philosophy of culture. That philosophy grasps the link between the new humanity inaugurated by Christ and all of humanity. In this way he holds up a picture of the public ministry of the church as a witness to the world's reconciliation to God.</p><p><strong>Jens Zimmermann</strong> is Canada Research Chair of Interpretation, Religion and Culture in the department of English, as well as professor of English and modern languages, at Trinity Western University in Langley, British Columbia. He is the author of <em>Recovering Theological Hermeneutics: An Incarnational-Trinitarian Theory of Interpretation</em> and coauthor of <em>The Passionate Intellect</em>."The book is an invaluable guide through the way that traditional Christian understandings of human beings and humanism have been engaged by critics through the centuries since the foundation of the Church." (Thomas Creedy, Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies, Vol. XXVI, Vol 1-2)<br><br>"This volume is an excellent mix of scholarship and confession. I recommend it for professors of Christian philosophy and systematic theology as well as historians and serious pastors." (Bruce Campbell Moyer, Andrews University Seminary Studies, Spring 2014)<br><br>"Despite wading through deep waters of theology and philosophy, the author's nimble prose makes this book readable and suitable for both advanced undergraduates and graduate students in theology. I would suggest it for inclusion in an introductory course on historical theology, and classes on Christianity and culture or philosophy and theology." (Michael Buttrey, The Conrad Grebel Review, Fall 2013)<br><br>"This work will help pastors and teachers appreciate the rich heritage of Christian thought and place these insights in frameworks that twenty-first century hearers can understand." (Charles Self, Encounter: Journal for Pentecostal Ministry, Fall 2013, Vol. 10)<br><br>"A timely and insightful analysis of how human beings, in the course of several centuries, have come to dominate a world and yet have lost their sense of what it means to be human. Jens Zimmermann demonstrates with depth and clarity the way that our common humanity was recovered in the incarnation and is communicated to us and to the world in the eucharist. This is truly a book for our times." (Barry Harvey, professor of theology in the Honors College, Baylor University)<br><br>"Zimmermann rightly challenges the dualism that remains endemic to much evangelical spirituality. Tracing the history of incarnational humanism, he presents a call back to a sacramental, participatory view of reality. Perhaps the most hopeful element of Zimmermann's account is its concluding plea for the centrality of the Eucharist for a Christian approach to the world. This book will become assigned reading for my Theology of Culture class!" (Hans Boersma, Regent College, Vancouver)<br><br>"At a time when various secular humanisms are thriving, Christians might imagine that the way forward is to make common cause with others in promoting human values without mentioning doctrines that specifically pertain to Christianity. With his characteristic erudition and eloquence, Jens Zimmermann shows that the opposite is the case: it is precisely in and through the incarnation of Jesus Christ that true humanism flourishes, because human life together requires the healing and hope that God brings by even now drawing us into his life. Without faith, hope and love, humanity founders. Zimmermann sheds profound light upon the full scope of life in Christ." (Matthew Levering, University of Dayton)<br><br>"I would certainly recommend this book as a must read for those who seek to develop a theology of culture or wish to defend the right of Christians to promote their values in the public square."

These are times of pluralism and disenchantment with organized religion. How do Christians today know which leaders and companions in faith to trust?<br>For help, Gerald McDermott returns to the work of Jonathan Edwards, the eighteenth-century preacher and college president widely regarded as the greatest American theologian ever. Edwards wrestled expertly with similar questions arising from frontier revivalism.<br>Now McDermott, not only a leading Edwards scholar but also a master teacher, makes Edward's insights accessible and practical for today's Christians. Seeing God offers a clarifying glimpse at the signs of genuine Christianity - yesterday, today and for the ages.</p><p>Gerald R. McDermott is assistant professor of religion and philosophy at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia.In the New Age, where the practice of spirituality takes on such a variety of forms, how is the Christian able to discern the signs of an authentic Christian spirituality? McDermott (religion, Roanoke Coll.) offers sound guidance for Christians seeking answers to this question. In the first half of the book, he demonstrates the ways that some religious behavior, like the frequent and passionate praise of God, is very often a sign of superficial spirituality. McDermott then turns to Jonathan Edwards's treatise on religious affections to mark out the signs of a reliable Christian spirituality, including seeing the beauty of holiness and hunger for God. In elegant prose, McDermott recovers through Edwards a sense of the transcendent that much contemporary spirituality lacks.

It was the spiritual umbrella for civilizations cradled by a continent endowed with the richest resources in the world. This way of life, however, was interrupted by the imposition of slavery on peoples of African descent. While there has been much literature on the many areas of black life that 300+ years of bondage has taken a devastating toll, we seem to overlook the effect it has had on our nutritional needs. Today, due to mass European commercialism, we have allowed our bodies to become human garbage disposals. Technology has made it possible for us to have our chemically saturated cake and eat it too as we consume anything with flavor cooked at record breaking speeds. The rat race has made us ignore our nutritional needs while we remain preoccupied with tailoring our lives to European standards. <br><br>'African Holistic Health' by Dr. Llaila O. Afrika, is the first major book which addresses these issues from a comprehensive Afri-centric viewpoint. It provides a complete guide to herbal remedies along with homeopathic disease treatments. What makes this book truly unique is the research Dr. Afrika has provided on the physiological and psychological differences between people of African descent versus people of European descent. In addition, Dr. Afrika provides a complete history (from the 9th to the 18th century) of the European herb and drug trade and why Europe invaded Africa for healing plants. Finally, he concludes by detailing how European diseases defeated ancient Africa. <br><br>After reading this book, you will learn about holistic sex laws, self diagnosis, disease treatments, the danger of commercial foods and much more. But the most important is about the concept of holistic health. Holistic health is concerned with the proper daily maintenance of the body, mind and spirit. Any nutritional approach must consider all three.</p><p></p><h2>Rules of Deception</h2><p><p>Dr. Jonathan Ransom, world-class mountaineer and surgeon for Doctors Without Borders, is climbing in the Swiss Alps with his beautiful wife, Emma, when a blizzard sets in. In their bid to escape the storm, Emma is killed when she falls into a hidden crevasse. <br><br>Twenty-four hours later, Jonathan receives an envelope addressed to his wife containing two baggage-claim tickets. Puzzled, he journeys to a remote railway station only to find himself in a life-and-death struggle for his wife&#x2019;s possessions. In the aftermath of the assault, he discovers that his attackers&#x2014;one dead, the other mortally wounded&#x2014;were, in fact, Swiss police officers. More frightening still is evidence of an extraordinary act of betrayal that leaves Jonathan stunned. <br><br>Suddenly the subject of an international manhunt and the target of a master assassin, Jonathan is forced on the run. His only chance at survival lies in uncovering the devastating truth behind the secret his wife kept from him and in stopping the terrifying conspiracy that threatens to bring the world to the brink of annihilation. Step by step, he is drawn deeper into a world of spies, high-tech weaponry, and global terrorism&#x2014;a world where no one is whom they appear to be and where the end always justifies the means. <br><br><i>Rules of Deception</i> is a brilliantly conceived, twisting tale of intrigue and deceit written by the master of the espionage thriller for the twenty-first century.</p></p><p><strong>Lee Child on <i>Rules of Deception</i></strong> <br> <i>Lee Child has crafted one of literature's most popular anti-heroes in the form of Jack Reacher, the iconic ex-military policeman of his bestselling novels. The author of <i>Nothing to Lose</i> talks about what makes a good thriller -- and why Christopher Reich is a novelist worthy of a gold medal.</i> <br> <br> I discovered Christopher Reich exactly ten years ago. His first book came out around the same time my second book was published. The modest prosperity that one&#x2019;s first book deal brings allowed me to pick up hardcovers that caught my eye. And <i>Numbered Account</i> caught my eye. And it lived up to its promise. It was fast, fresh, glossy, and very exciting. I thought: Reich is a keeper. <br> <br> And then he got better. It was always clear that he had talent to burn, but he chose to accompany it with a real work ethic. His second, third and fourth books built and built until the release of the next one was an event to be anticipated. (And right there is my only complaint: Reich doesn&#x2019;t write fast enough.) <br> <br> His fifth book - <i>The Patriot's Club</i> - was a real achievement. It was a slam-dunk winner of the International Thriller Writer&#x2019;s first annual Best Novel award. Awards are often awkward. There&#x2019;s usually a measure of grumbling, because often people don&#x2019;t agree with the choice of winner. But not a word was heard against "The Patriot&#x2019;s Club." In fact nothing was heard, because the applause was too loud. <br> <br> So I was really looking forward to <i>Rules of Deception</i>. I got an advance copy. I cracked it open. I started reading. Mostly I read like any other reader, but a small part of me reads like a writer. I think all writers experience the same thing. We sense things between the lines, especially energy and inspiration. <br> <br> And ambition. <br> <br> <i>Rules of Deception</i> starts with a short prologue, and then the first chapter introduces Jonathan Ransom, the main character. Two pages, and then nine pages. The prologue is a teaser. It baits the hook. It&#x2019;s a two-page masterpiece. It&#x2019;s intriguing, and then it&#x2019;s really intriguing. It promises big things ahead. Then chapter one introduces the guy who&#x2019;s going to have to deal with them. And why, indirectly. <br> <br> Eleven pages. The reader in me wanted to race ahead. But the writer in me had to pause a moment. Because between the lines I was sensing something. Maybe because it&#x2019;s an Olympic year I can only explain it like this: picture the high jump event. Six competitors are still in. Then five, then four. Then three. Then the gold, the silver, and the bronze are settled. But the rules of track and field allow the winner to go on. The bar is raised. A personal best. The Olympic record. The bar is raised again. World record height. The stadium goes quiet. The jumper stills himself on the runway. Intense concentration. The gold medal is already in the bag. Uncharted territory. The jumper rocks from foot to foot, his mind on nothing except jumping higher than he has ever jumped before. <br> <br> That&#x2019;s exactly the between-the-lines feeling I was getting from Reich, eleven pages into <i>Rules of Deception</i> - a world-class writer preparing to accomplish something truly noteworthy. <br> <br> There are a further 377 pages. They live up to the promise. <i>--Lee Child</i> <br> <br> <strong>Amazon Exclusive Essay: Christopher Reich on Thrillers</strong><br> <i>Name your five favorite books.</i> <br> <br> For me they&#x2019;re all thrillers. <i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, <i>Eye of the Needle</i>, <i>The Bourne Identity</i> , <i>Noble House</i>, and <i>The Spy Who Came in From the Cold</i>. My life stopped when I picked up each of those books and it didn&#x2019;t start again until I finished the last page. I didn&#x2019;t actually read them so much as disappear between their covers. That was me trying to catch the Jackal before he assassinated Charles De Gaulle, and me again at the wheel of a Jaguar XKE convertible racing down the Peak in Hong Kong. The fact is that for me life is somehow better when I&#x2019;m reading a great book. Richer, more exciting...heck, I don&#x2019;t know, just better. <br> <br> About two years ago, I decided that it was my turn to write the thriller I&#x2019;d always wanted to read. I knew exactly where to start. All I had to do was "write what I know." These days, I know a lot about the intelligence community. Not the stuff you read about in the papers -- the stuff you never read about. Over the years, I&#x2019;ve made a lot of friends in Washington and overseas. Diplomats, spies, soldiers, politicians &#x2013; men and women at the highest levels of government. And, I can assure you that what they&#x2019;ve taught me about how the world really works is a lot more interesting and a lot more frightening than you&#x2019;d ever imagine. <br> <br> That&#x2019;s where my newest book, <i>Rules of Deception</i>, comes in. It&#x2019;s a story about an honest and courageous doctor named Jonathan Ransom. He&#x2019;s a surgeon who works for Doctors Without Borders in some of the toughest parts of the world. He&#x2019;s a happily married man with a big heart and a beautiful English wife he deeply loves named Emma who works with him. What Jonathan doesn&#x2019;t know is that nothing about his life is what it seems. In fact, it&#x2019;s all a web of lies and he&#x2019;s caught in the middle of something extraordinarily dangerous. <br> <br> I can&#x2019;t say more than that, and I shouldn&#x2019;t have to, because if I&#x2019;ve done my job right, when you get to page five you&#x2019;ll be hooked and you won&#x2019;t come up for air until it&#x2019;s all said and done. <i>--Christopher Reich</i> <br><p>CHRISTOPHER REICH is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Numbered Account </i>and <i>The Patriots Club</i>, the latter of which won the International Thriller Writers Award for Best Novel in 2006.

Original.</p><p>Former Marine and current mystery-bookstore owner Penelope Warren and her cat, Mycroft, come home one day to find the dead body of Empty Creek's wealthy busybody, Louise Fletcher, on their porch and involve themselves in the murder investigation. The murder weapon, a chopping knife, may have been intended for Warren, also known as Penny, since a penny is attached to the handle; later Warren discovers that the victim kept detailed files on almost every citizen of Empty Creek. This mystery has an appealing cast of eccentrics, including Warren's klutzy boyfriend, newspaper editor Harris Anderson III; romance novelist Elaine Henders; and Warren's sister, who acts in B-movies under the name of Storm Williams. The setting is a pleasant Arizona desert town whose single bar serves as a gathering place--even Mycroft laps up non-alcoholic beer while seated on a stool. The plot is thinner than that suspicious penny, however, and relies heavily on coy love scenes involving games with names like Sailor and Sex Machine. Allen, whose Come Nightfall was published under a pseudonym and nominated for an Edgar Award, does involve the feline without getting precious. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Favorite Bride (Governess Brides, Book 6)</h2><p><b>New York Times bestselling author Christina Dodd brings you "The Sound of Music meets Jane Eyre" in her refreshingly humorous addition to the Governess Brides series...</b><br><b></b><br>When Miss Samantha Prendregast arrives at Devil's Fell to take charge of six rebellious girls, the vibrant, outspoken governess finds she can manage the children with intelligence, guile...and a little bribery.

I&#x2019;m back after two grueling weeks of work in Iraq, a photo shoot on the new postwar architecture of Baghdad, pastels and sleek modern structures blooming incongruously alongside exquisite medieval buildings and the rubble of destruction.<br> <br>I open the arched wooden door to the half-timbered Tudor cottage Nick and I rent in Hampstead and call out that I&#x2019;m home. Outside, the cab pulls away now that the driver, an elderly gentleman with an old-fashioned sense of chivalry, believes I&#x2019;m safely inside. When Nick doesn&#x2019;t answer, I figure he&#x2019;s already upstairs, either in his study&#x2014;he&#x2019;s been working so hard lately&#x2014;or in bed reading. A bottle of Veuve Cliquot will be chilling in the silver bucket he bought at a flea market after the seller swore it was used at the Ch�teau de Cond� for the wedding of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. There will be red roses, for passion, on my pillow.<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t have to tell me. I know I&#x2019;m lucky.<br> <br>Then I see blood, illuminated by a swath of golden light from the lantern at the front door. Frantically, I begin turning on lights throughout the silent house. The blood is dark and rust colored, but I can tell it&#x2019;s recent, not more than four or five hours old. The last time Nick and I spoke was in Istanbul as I boarded my connecting flight. Just before I hung up he told me he loved me, as he always does, and I started to say, &#x201c;Love you more,&#x201d; because that&#x2019;s our routine. But my phone, down to a sliver of a battery, died before I got the words out. I never got to tell him that one last time, and it still haunts me.<br> <br>I set down my equipment bag and suitcase and unstrap my tripod, which I wield like a saber as I follow the path of blood spatter. Signs of a struggle and someone being dragged. A partial handprint on the wall of our sitting room, like a child&#x2019;s art project. I call Nick&#x2019;s name, hoping he&#x2019;s still here, and pray he hasn&#x2019;t bled out. The house has a tomblike stillness about it and somehow I know his attacker or attackers are gone.<br> <br>And so is Nick. In the sitting room, a bottle of Scotch is overturned, the clear liquid leaving a dark wet stain on the Bukhara carpet I brought back from an assignment in Afghanistan. His glass has rolled under the settee, and his book, John Julius Norwich&#x2019;s Byzantium: The Early Centuries, lies splayed open on the floor.<br> <br>Upstairs, the blue-and-white Amish wedding ring quilt on our bed is gone. The blankets are askew, so it was probably dragged off in haste and I know that is how he left the house, bundled in the quilt under which we&#x2019;d made love so many times.<br> <br>Otherwise, our bedroom looks as it always does, and his clothes are still hanging in the armoire or folded in his dresser&#x2014;suits arranged by season, shoes and work boots lined up in two rows, ties draped over the antique rack I found in a shop on Portobello Road. Sweaters, underwear, socks organized neatly in the drawers.<br> <br>The computer is switched off in his study. His desk is immaculate, as usual. Nick doesn&#x2019;t leave work around, not in his business.<br> <br>I stand there for what seems like ages, wondering whom to call: 999, which will bring officers from the Hampstead police station? Scotland Yard?<br> <br>But I know what I&#x2019;m supposed to do and reach for my phone.<br> <br>I call Nick&#x2019;s people and they come. The regional security officer from the American embassy and a bland man with a forgettable face who says his name is John Brown.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s it. That&#x2019;s all I, Sophie Medina, can tell you with absolute certainty about the night my husband, Nicholas Canning, was abducted from our home. Everything else, the rest of that night&#x2014;sirens wailing, bright lights strobing the quiet darkness, doors slamming, voices raised in alarm&#x2014;is a blur.</p><h2>The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix</h2><p>Jimi Hendrix, according to The Penguin Encyclopedia of Popular Music, was "without a doubt the most prodigiously original, inventive and influential guitarist of the rock era". He died on 18 September 1970. Monika Dannemann had been his fiancee for nearly two years; she was with him when he died.<br>The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix is Monika's tribute to her lost love: a beautifully designed, exquisitely executed gallery of her original oil paintings, inspired by Jimi's songs, and reflecting his spirit. All are reproduced in full colour, and each is accompanied by an explanatory commentary expressing some of Jimi's innermost thoughts about his music, life, death, love and spirituality as revealed by him to Monika.<br>In separate sections the author writes candidly, and very movingly, about her time with Jimi, their relationship, his last days, and his tragically premature death at the age of only twenty-seven. For the first time ever she discloses the full truth about the circumstances surrounding his death, and recounts in detail the distressing months that followed as the facts were continually manipulated and distorted, especially by the media.<br>Published to coincide with the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix also includes a sequence of previously unpublished colour photographs of Jimi, taken by Monika the day before he died.</p><p></p><h2>Honey, I&#39;m Homemade: Sweet Treats from the Beehive across the Centuries and around the World</h2><p><i>Honey, I'm Homemade: Sweet Treats from the Beehive across the Centuries and around the World</i> showcases a wealth of recipes for cookies, breads, pies, puddings, and cakes that feature honey as an essential ingredient. Noted entomologist May Berenbaum also details the fascinating history of honey harvesting and consumption around the world, explains the honey bee's extraordinary capacity to process nectar into concentrated sweetness, and marvels at honey's diverse flavors and health benefits.&nbsp;Honey is a unique food because of its power to evoke a particular time and place. Every time it is collected from a hive, honey takes on the nuanced flavors of a particular set of flowers--clover, orange blossoms, buckwheat, or others--at a certain point in time processed and stored by a particular group of bees. Honey is not just a snapshot of a time and place--it's the <i>taste</i> of a time and place, and it lends its flavors to the delectable baked goods and other treats found here.&nbsp;More than a cookbook, <i>Honey, I'm Homemade</i> is a tribute to the remarkable work of <i>Apis mellifera,</i> the humble honey bee whose pollination services allow three-quarters of all flowering plant species to reproduce and flourish. Sales of the book will benefit the University of Illinois Pollinatarium--the first freestanding science outreach center in the nation devoted to flowering plants and their pollinators.&nbsp;Because so much depends on honey bees, and because people have benefited from their labors for millennia, <i>Honey, I'm Homemade</i> is the perfect way to share and celebrate honey's sweetness and delight.</p><p><p> </p><b>May Berenbaum</b> is Swanlund Professor of Entomology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

A classic tale of discovery and solitude returns to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for its 50th anniversary, with a new introduction by Lois Lowry.<br> <br> <br> <p> <b>Amazon Exclusive: A Letter from Lois Lowry on Writing the Introduction to <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins, 50th Anniversary Edition</i></b></p><p></p> Dear Amazon readers,<p></p> <p></p> Last summer, when I was asked to write an introduction to a new edition of <i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>, my mind went back in time to the 1960s, when my children were young and it was one of their best-loved books.<p></p> But a later memory surfaced, as well, of a party I was invited to in the summer of 1979. By now the kids were grown. I was in New York to attend a convention of the American Library Association, and Scott O'Dell's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, was honoring him at a reception being held at the St. Regis Hotel. I had never met Mr. O'Dell. But because of my own children I knew his books, and I was pleased to be invited to such an illustrious event.<p></p> I was staying at a nearby hotel and planned to walk over to the party. But when I began to get dressed, I encountered a problem. I was wearing, I remember, a rose-colored cr�pe de Chine dress. It buttoned up the back. I was alone in my hotel room. I buttoned the bottom buttons, and I buttoned the top buttons, but there was one button in the middle of my back that I simply couldn&#x2019;t reach. It makes me laugh today, thinking about it, picturing the contortions I went through in that hotel room: twisting my arms, twisting my back, all to no avail. <p></p> The clock was ticking. The party would start soon. I had no other clothes except the casual things I'd been wearing all day and which were now wrinkled from the summer heat.<p></p> Finally I decided, <i>The heck with it</i>. I left the room with the button unbuttoned and headed off. When I got in my hotel elevator, a benign-looking older couple, probably tourists from the Midwest, were already standing inside, and I explained my predicament politely and asked if they could give me a hand. The gray-haired man kindly buttoned my dress for me.<p></p> We parted company in the lobby of my hotel and off I went to the St. Regis, where I milled around and chatted with countless people, sipped wine, and waited for the guest of honor, Scott O'Dell, to be introduced. When he was, of course he turned out to be the eighty-one-year-old man who had buttoned my dress.<p></p> But wait! There's more. Ten years passed.<p></p> I had never seen Mr. O'Dell during the intervening years, but now, suddenly, we were the two speakers at a luncheon being held on a college campus somewhere. I think it may have been Vassar.<p></p> We sat next to each other at the head table, nibbling our chicken, chatting about the weather. I knew he wouldn't remember me, but I certainly remembered him, and I was secretly thinking that when it was my turn to speak, I might tell the audience the amusing little anecdote about the button on my dress. But he went first. And, eyes twinkling, he started his speech with "The last time I was with Lois Lowry, we were in a New York hotel. I was helping her get dressed." He was ninety-one at the time. All of this floated back into my mind when I found myself rereading, last summer, <i>The Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>. None of it was appropriate to the book's introduction, of course, and I went on to write, instead, about the power of the story and the magnificence of the writing. Not that anyone needed reminding! There has never been a question about Scott O'Dell's brilliance as a writer and storyteller. But it's nice to have a chance, here, to tell an audience that he was also a sweet and funny man.<p></p> <i>Lois Lowry</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Neil Giordano)</p> <br> <br><i>Island of the Blue Dolphins</i>978-0-547-32861-4$6.99 PA</p><h2>Desert Places</h2><p><b>Greetings.

Sparta is also one of a handful of ancient Greek cities with enough existing evidence for historians to create a realistic social portrait. Over the past quarter-century Paul Cartledge has established himself as the leading international authority on ancient Sparta. <i>Spartan Reflections</i> is a superb collection of his essays&#x2014;two are published here for the first time, and the rest, often difficult to locate, have been revised and updated for publication in book form. Giving us a real sense of what Sparta was like as a culture, these essays constitute a fascinating introduction to and overview of ancient Spartan history and its reception. This collection, unique in breadth and scope, will be an essential source for anyone interested in this idiosyncratic society.<br><br>Cartledge brings us up to date on what is known about the most important and intriguing aspects of Sparta: its military development, questions of gender and sexuality, and the difficult problem of artistic and literary aspects of Sparta. We learn about the institutions that distinguished Sparta from other city-states, including its religion, education process, degree of literacy, secret service, unusual system of servitude, and institutionalized pederasty. Throughout, Cartledge also makes important comparisons with Athens, helping us grasp what is really striking about Sparta.<br><br> Cartledge's writing is clear and engaging as he draws from myriad sources both ancient and modern, as well as from political and cultural theory. These essays, together with their magisterial bibliography, demonstrate his remarkable scholarly and intellectual range. <i>Spartan Reflections</i> will be an important source on the most significant issues in Sparta scholarship today as well as a fascinating look at this culture for general readers.<br><br>A Selection of the History Book Club</p><p>"This is a book that scholars will read with pleasure, and a book from which advanced undergraduates and graduates will gain a sense of what Sparta was like as a culture, and (just as important) the nature and state of play of contemporary Spartan studies. And it will be accessible for the well informed lay reader as well."&#x2014;Josiah Ober, author of <i>Political Dissent in Democratic Athens</i><br><br>"Paul Cartledge's aim, in this powerful collection of essays, is to shed light in dark places, to demythicize... Cartledge is shrewd, realistic, and far from starry-eyed. Over a quarter-century's exhaustive research, now updated, has gone into these densely documented and tightly argued essays. These Spartans, in the last resort, are exploitative slave-drivers, obsessed with keeping their serfs down (by annually killing off any resisters, among other things)... Modern idealizers of cold baths, black broth, mindless discipline and long route marches should read this book and, hopefully, have second thoughts."&#x2014;Peter Green, author of <i>Alexander to Actium</i><b>Paul Cartledge</b> is Professor of Greek History, University of Cambridge.

Terri lives with her husband and daughter in a small village in southwest England.This engrossing collection of short stories tackles a single question: What happens to humanity following a disaster that causes calamitous, fundamental, and long-lasting change? Nineteen authors answer in stories that tackle political upheaval (Reunion, by Susan Beth Pfeffer); ecological disaster (Visiting Nelson, by Katherine Langrish); doomsday cults (All I Know of Freedom, by Carol Emshwiller); and inexplicable phenomena (The Easthound, by Nalo Hopkinson). The editors have forgone purist definitions of dystopia&#x2014;by also including stories of an apocalyptic nature&#x2014;in an attempt to recognize the range of dystoptian fiction being written today. A brief history of the development of dys-lit concludes the collection. Fans of the genre will naturally gravitate toward After and find much to enjoy. Others may simply be attracted to the names Jane Yolen, Garth Nix, Gregory Maguire, Beth Revis, Cecil Castellucci, and Carrie Ryan; even if they come for their favorites, they&#x2019;ll want to stick around for the rest.

The members of the Tower Writers' Collective are famous and semi-famous writers who conflict with one another over both literary and personal matters. When Cameron Harris is found propped up in a closet with a chapter of his latest manuscript--a roman a clef with digs in it about every literary figure in town--on his lap, the collective's members are prime suspects. Lake ( Poisoned Ivy ) uses the setting to make tongue-in-cheek and self-referential jokes about the literary scene. A wispy poetess ends one reading with a poem about the penis being an underdeveloped vagina, and at a dinner party another author suggests that a female campus police officer "would be an interesting subject for a novel, or at least a story." O'Neill's romantic involvement with one of the collective's members is an effective device, since it explains her presence at the scene of the crime and gives her access to the group, but Lake does not explore the relationship and ties it up too neatly when O'Neill's suitor decides to go live in South America. When he promises to write, the familiar phrase takes on a sinister cast. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wicked Lies: A Men of Summer Novel</h2><p><p><b>From #1 bestselling author Lora Leigh comes <i>Wicked Lies, </i>a sizzling <i>New York Times</i> bestseller of the Men of Summer-their ways and means, and the women they desire...</b></p><p><b>HE'S TEMPTING FATE</b><br>Jazz Lancing is the stuff of legends.

Properly understood, they can tell us how the teams we root for could employ better strategies, put more effective players on the field, and win more games. The revolution in baseball statistics that began in the 1970s is a controversial subject that professionals and fans alike argue over without end. Despite this fundamental change in the way we watch and understand the sport, no one has written the book that reveals, across every area of strategy and management, how the best practitioners of statistical analysis in baseball-people like Bill James, Billy Beane, and Theo Epstein-think about numbers and the game. <i>Baseball Between the Numbers</i> is that book. In separate chapters covering every aspect of the game, from hitting, pitching, and fielding to roster construction and the scouting and drafting of players, the experts at Baseball Prospectus examine the subtle, hidden aspects of the game, bring them out into the open, and show us how our favorite teams could win more games. This is a book that every fan, every follower of sports radio, every fantasy player, every coach, and every player, at every level, can learn from and enjoy.</p><p><b>Baseball Prospectus</b> is the top statistical web site in baseball and is extensively used, in print and on air, by a wide range of major broadcasters, magazines, and daily newspapers that cover Major League Baseball.Who deserves recognition as the best baseball player of all time--Barry Bonds or Babe Ruth? The stuff of endless debates among baseball fans, such questions come into sharp focus when the experts of <i>Baseball Prospectus</i> start parsing their trove of statistics. Looking, for instance, at the Bonds-versus-Ruth issue, the <i>BP </i>statisticians systematically adjust the two stars' numbers to reflect changes in parks, in level of competition, and in training technology as they establish that although Ruth still holds the overall edge, Bonds could overtake him with a couple more good seasons. But these baseball mavens look beyond the performance of individual players, as they examine entire teams (the '04 Red Sox and '01 Diamondbacks, for instance) and even whole epochs (the golden era of 1949--57). <i>BP </i>numbers help readers see the world beyond the diamond as well, clarifying the economic pressures that push marginal players to use steroids and are increasingly pushing working-class fans right out of the stadiums their taxes are subsidizing. A valuable reference for baseball fans and cultural critics alike. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is a formidable world, and the people who live there are constantly subjected to extremes-of place and of culture.</p><p><i>The Wandering Falcon</i> begins with a young couple, refugees from their tribe, who have traveled to the middle of nowhere to escape the cruel punishments meted out upon those who transgress the boundaries of marriage and family. Their son, Tor Baz, descended from both chiefs and outlaws, becomes "The Wandering Falcon," a character who travels among the tribes, over the mountains and the plains, into the towns and the tents that constitute the homes of the tribal people. The media today speak about this unimaginably remote region, a geopolitical hotbed of conspiracies, drone attacks, and conflict, but in the rich, dramatic tones of a master storyteller, this stunning, honor-bound culture is revealed from the inside.</p><p>Jamil Ahmad has written an unforgettable portrait of a world of custom and compassion, of love and cruelty, of hardship and survival, a place fragile, unknown, and unforgiving.</p></p><p><b>Jamil Ahmad</b> was born in 1930. He joined the Civil Service of Pakistan in 1954 and served mainly in the Frontier Province and Baluchistan. He was also development commissioner for the Frontier and chairman of the Tribal Development Corporation, and was posted as minister in Pakistan's embassy in Kabul at a critical time, before and during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He lives in Islamabad with his wife, Helga Ahmad, a nationally recognized environmentalist and social worker. This is his first book."Superb.

From page one, I was transported to a land of nomadic tribes who live and die by ancestral codes. But <i>The Wandering Falcon</i> is not only about tribes. It is about honor, love, loyalty, and grace. And it is about borders--geographical, political, and personal. The terrain where Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan meet may be cruel and unforgiving, but every page of this book is filled with beauty and humanity. By the final pages, I found myself transformed." &#x2013; Nami Mun, author of <i>Miles from Nowhere</i><br><br>"I've been talking about this book to anyone who will listen.

The book offers a rich picture of the "mountainous, lawless tribal areas" we have previously known mainly for bullets and bombs." &#x2013; Steve Inskeep, <i>NPR</i><br><br>"A striking debut...The power and beauty of these stories are unparalleled in most fiction to come out of south Asia." &#x2013; <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"[W]ritten with such a terrible beauty...With this novel Ahmad has followed Mark Twain''s advice to write what he knows. And what he know is all the more fiction-worthy for his lived experience among these hardy people, much feared and little known...Highly accomplished first novel...Elegiac voice...They are neither romanticized nor vilified but shown in all their terrible, resilient beauty." &#x2013; <i>The Independent </i>(UK)<br><br>"Tautly written... Fantastic... Drawn with tenderness but without sentimentality... Ahmad is a deft storyteller and his slim volume possesses a strong allure." &#x2013; Financial Times<br><br>"Outstanding...The novel is more than a beautifully written piece of fiction; it is a socio-anthropological account of a tribal landscape that is changing rapidly.

Nicola Fuller and her husband were a glamorous and optimistic couple and East Africa lay before them with the promise of all its perfect light, even as the British Empire in which they both believed waned. They had everything, including two golden children - a girl and a boy. However, life became increasingly difficult and they moved to Rhodesia to work as farm managers. The previous farm manager had committed suicide. His ghost appeared at the foot of their bed and seemed to be trying to warn them of something. Shortly after this, one of their golden children died. Africa was no longer the playground of Nicola&#39;s childhood. They returned to England where the author was born before they returned to Rhodesia and to the civil war. The last part of the book sees the Fullers in their old age on a banana and fish farm in the Zambezi Valley. They had built their ramshackle dining room under the Tree of Forgetfulness. In local custom, this tree is the meeting place for villagers determined to resolve disputes. It is in the spirit of this Forgetfulness that Nicola finally forgot - but did not forgive - all her enemies including her daughter and the Apostle, a squatter who has taken up in her bananas with his seven wives and forty-nine children. Funny, tragic, terrifying, exotic and utterly unself-conscious, this is a story of survival and madness, love and war, passion and compassion.</p><p>Alexandra Fuller was born in England in 1969 and in 1972 she moved with her family to a farm in Rhodesia. After the civil war there in 1981, the Fullers moved first to Malawi, then to Zambia.

R. F. Keating Award from the International Crime Writers Association</b><br><b></b><br><b>From Michael Sims, the acclaimed author of <i>The Story of Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i>, the rich, true tale tracing the young Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s creation of Sherlock Holmes and the modern detective story.</b></p><p>As a young medical student, Arthur Conan Doyle studied in Edinburgh under the vigilant eye of a diagnostic genius, Dr. Joseph Bell. Doyle often observed Bell identifying a patient&#x2019;s occupation, hometown, and ailments from the smallest details of dress, gait, and speech. Although Doyle was training to be a surgeon, he was meanwhile cultivating essential knowledge that would feed his literary dreams and help him develop the most iconic detective in fiction. </p><p>Michael Sims traces the circuitous development of Conan Doyle as the father of the modern mystery, from his early days in Edinburgh surrounded by poverty and violence, through his escape to University (where he gained terrifying firsthand knowledge of poisons), leading to his own medical practice in 1882. Five hardworking years later--after Doyle's only modest success in both medicine and literature--Sherlock Holmes emerged in <i>A Study in Scarlet</i>.Sims deftly shows Holmes to be a product of Doyle&#x2019;s varied adventures in his personal and professional life, as well as built out of the traditions of Edgar Allan Poe, �mile Gaboriau, Wilkie Collins, and Charles Dickens--not just a skillful translator of clues, but a veritable superhero of the mind in the tradition of Doyle&#x2019;s esteemed teacher. </p><p>Filled with details that will surprise even the most knowledgeable Sherlockian, <i>Arthur and Sherlock</i> is a literary genesis story for detective fans everywhere.</p></p><p><b>Michael Sims </b>is the author of <i>The Story of Charlotte's Web</i>, which the <i>Washington Post</i>,<i> Boston Globe</i>, and other venues chose as a Best Book of the year; <i>Adam's Navel</i>, which was a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book and a <i>Library Journal</i> Best Science Book; <i>The Adventures of Henry Thoreau</i>; and other books. He edits The Connoisseur's Collection series of Victorian anthologies, including <i>The Dead Witness</i> (detective stories), and also edited <i>The Penguin Book of Victorian Women in Crime</i> and <i>The Penguin Book of Gaslight Crime</i>. His Sherlockian pastiche &#x201c;The Memoirs of Silver Blaze&#x201d; appears in the Anthony Award-winning anthology <i>In the Company of Sherlock Holmes</i>. He lives in western Pennsylvania with his wife and son.<p>"With all the brilliance of Sherlock himself . . . Sim's magnificent work of scholarship isn't a birth-to-death biography of Conan Doyle but a more specific investigation . . . [which] reads something like a superhero origin story . . . Sims, the author of books on E.B. White and Henry Thoreau, is himself an ingenious investigator. Among his most intriguing explorations is his teasing out of not just Conan Doyle&#x2019;s personal history but the history of the detective story itself." - <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"For those who can't get enough, Michael Sims's engaging new book, <i>Arthur and Sherlock</i>, describes how Arthur Conan Doyle invented his famous detective . . . Enlightening" - <i>Washington Post</i></p><p>"Fans of Sherlock Holmes who want to know about the equally remarkable man who created him can learn a good deal from Arthur and Sherlock by Michael Sims. Mr. Sims has cast a broad net over existing sources to tell the story of Conan Doyle's early life, how he came to create Holmes and the hurdles the young doctor surmounted to become one of the English-speaking world's best known authors . . . <i>Arthur and Sherlock</i> captures both [Joseph] Bell's central role in the making of Sherlock and Conan Doyle's unstinting gratitude to him." - <i>Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Sims's expertise in both literature and history is again on display . . . In <i>Arthur and Sherlock </i>Sims has written not just a wonderful narrative of the invention of a beloved character but a case study of the creative process. By following all the leads and tracking down all the clues that led Doyle to Holmes, Sims illustrates the miracle of literature." - <i>Chapter16.org</i></p><p>"Many Holmes fans know the bones of the origin story, but Sims dives deep into Conan Doyle&#x2019;s biography to put flesh on it. The physician-turned-writer becomes much more human to the reader in the process." - <i>Seattle Times</i></p><p>"A delightful piece of detective work." - <i>Nature</i></p><p>"Sims' story effectively retells the story of the young Doyle as something of a Holmes himself, someone who could persuade readers that 'seeming clairvoyance beyond the limits of direct knowledge was possible in the real world.' The author's deeply researched but reader-friendly take on Doyle and Holmes fits nicely along recent books by Michael Dirda and Barry Grant, and it stands, like Samuel Rosenberg's centrifugal book <i>Naked Is the Best Disguise</i> (1974), as a work of literature all its own. Even the most learned of Baker Street Irregulars will enjoy Sims' look at the making of Sherlock Holmes." - starred review, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Sims makes clear just how much of [Joseph Bell's] brilliant and theatrical persona was infused into Sherlock . . . [A] well-told biographical tale . . . There is much to observe here." - <i>Dallas Morning News</i></p><p>"Concise and well-written. . . [with] passages that read as if Dr. Watson was penning them. Sims's skill and deftness with narrative biography will lead Sherlockians to hope that he continues the story of Conan Doyle's life in a future volume." - <i>Publisher's Weekly</i></p><p>"A warm and affectionate look at how Arthur Conan Doyle introduced the Great Detective and the Good Doctor to the world! Sims traces Holmes's literary ancestors as well as Doyle's personal contributions, producing a carefully researched but thoroughly readable work that will surely appeal to the millions of Holmes's admirers as well as students of crime-writing." - Leslie S. Klinger, Editor, THE NEW ANNOTATED SHERLOCK HOLMES</p><p>"Sims combines extensive scholarship with excellent writing and organizational skills to produce a work that is not only informative but eminently readable. What's most interesting is how he places Doyle, Holmes and the genre in historical context." - <i>Minneapolis Star Tribune</i></p><p>"Stuffed with fascinating detail. . . . The book is brimfull of Holmesian arcana and minutiae. . . . Offers many intriguing insights into Holmes&#x2019;s evolution . . . . A stimulating contribution to our never-ending fascination with Sherlock Holmes, and, even more perhaps, with his genial creator." - Christopher Hart, <i>Sunday Times (London)</i></p><p>"This volume may tread a well-trod path, but it does so with fresh eyes. Sims combines his talent as a science writer and a literary critic as he traces the career of Conan Doyle under the tutelage of Dr. Joseph Bell, and traces the influence of Poe, Gaboriau, Dickens, and Collins." - <i>Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</i></p><p>"Sims examines Doyle's youth in Edinburgh, where he lived amid poverty and violence, as well as his university studies and medical practice. Drawing connections between the adventures in Doyle's professional life and the life of Doyle's cherished character, <i>Arthur and Sherlock</i> will prove fascinating to Sherlock Holmes connoisseurs, and is a 'must' for public and college library Literary Studies collections.

Author James Fenton has a style that is both intimate and scholarly. It is always amusing and illuminating; it never cloys. The subjects of the 15 essays--all but two originally published in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>--include Freud's collection of statuary; the remarks of Renoir and Degas made at two parties in the same home (the artists, not on speaking terms, were invited on different nights); Jasper Johns's early life and his later use of the American flag in his paintings; a talented nephew of Leonardo da Vinci whose work was oddly described by both Vasari and Picasso; and more.<p> Fenton's writing is most moving in those essays that take off from a chance thought or a bit of accidentally discovered history, like the one on Freud. And those that began as book reviews are in a class by themselves. Fenton generally shreds or praises his subjects according to his own meticulous research, which refreshingly tends toward primary sources, but occasionally he simply takes the reader aside. Quoting one critic, he groans, "If this sort of writing makes you want to throw up, I quite agree." His, on the other hand, makes one want to turn back to the beginning of the book and start all over again. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>James Fenton is Professor of Poetry at Oxford and a regular contributor to The New York Review of Books. His most recent book of poetry is Out of Danger (Noonday, 1995).

In this riveting, informative and entertaining book Cita Stelzer draws on previously untapped archival material, diaries of guests, and a wide variety of other sources to tell of some of the key dinners at which Churchill presided before, during and after World War II - including the important conferences at which he used his considerable skills to attempt to persuade his allies, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, to fight the war according to his strategic vision. With fascinating new insights into the food he ate, the champagnes he loved, as well as original menus, seating plans and unpublished photographs, Dinner with Churchill is a sumptuous treat. The next best thing to being there yourself.</p><p>A freelance editor and journalist, and a Research Associate at the Hudson Institute, Cita Stelzer majored in history and went on to work for John Lindsay, Mayor of New York and Governor Hugh Carey.

She hopes you enjoy listening as much as she enjoys narrating!</p>The prologue of veteran horror writer Saul's ( Second Child ) new novel is wonderfully scary: A pregnant teenage "swamp rat" of the Everglades, spying on a secret meeting of "the Dark Man" and "his children," sees a friend offer up her newborn baby, whereupon the masked Dark Man plunges a knife into the infant. Right after that, the teenager's husband promises to deliver his own child "the night he's born." The story proper begins when 16-year-old Kelly Anderson, all her life having suffered nightmares of a menacing old man and now sure she's pregnant by him, tries to kill herself. She recovers and moves from Atlanta with her adoptive parents to her grandfather's house just north of the Everglades. Kelly becomes friends with Michael, her age and also adopted, who admits to similar nightmares and a sense of dread. Michael's adoptive mother, meanwhile, feels a strange kinship to Kelly. The secrets of the Dark Man--his identity and his fountain-of-youth formula--are revealed halfway through the book, and thenceforth the story slides into descriptions of relatively tame to-and-fro-ing, mostly in the swamp, and the revolting revenge of "the children" on a group of nasty but well-preserved old men. Saul's ending is cozily sentimental. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cowgirl for Keeps (Four Stones Ranch, 3)</h2><p><em><b>Lassoing the Cowgirl</b></em><em><b>&nbsp;</b></em><br><br>Rosamond Northam's plans of building a high school take an unexpected turn when her father informs her she'll be overseeing construction of a new hotel instead&#x2014;with Englishman Garrick Wakefield.

Garrick Wakefield waved a dismissive hand toward the crowds milling about the Denver train station. His gesture stirred up the stench of burning coal and unwashed bodies. "It's far worse than I expected."<br><br>Most travelers on the platform beneath them were clearly lower class. Unkempt children dashed about with no parental restraint. Cowboys&#x2014;he shuddered at the term&#x2014;wore guns strapped to their dusty, wrinkled trousers. Beggars sat against the depot's brick walls, their hands lifted in supplication to all passersby. In grating American accents, hawkers advertised their wares. How Garrick longed for a pastoral English countryside.<br><br>"Tut, tut, old man. It's not so bad." Percy, ever the optimist, could afford to overlook the chaos. A cousin from Garrick's mother's family, with an unentailed inheritance to spend as he wished, Percy didn't face a future dependent upon another man's whimsy. "I find this country delightful."<br><br>"Indeed? How so?" Garrick spied a mother on the lower platform struggling with tattered baggage and several children. Compassion welled up inside him. Where was the woman's husband? If he could get through the tangled crowd, he'd offer to help. Why didn't one of those cowboys or another closer man lend a hand? Their neglect validated Garrick's disdain for the lot of them. If she came closer, he'd step down and offer assistance.<br><br>"Look at the beautiful scenery." Percy indicated the mountains to the west. "Every bit as majestic as the Scottish Highlands, what?" His eyes brightened. "Can you not feel the call to climb them?"<br><br>"I'll grant you that. But remember the endless rivers and plains we crossed to get here." At least they'd traveled by train, not in oxen-drawn covered wagons such as those they'd passed along the way. "Too much wasteland."<br><br>A conductor called "All aboard," and the crowd moved toward the train's open doors, where uniformed porters assisted passengers up the steps. A quick glance down the length of the platform assured Garrick that his and Percy's valets were seeing to their trunks.<br><br>"These Americans have no manners, no refinement. If Uncle could see them, he'd change his mind about this business venture." After a lifetime of prejudice against all things American, Lord Westbourne had met one single gentleman rancher and revised his opinion of the entire country. He'd sent Garrick to build a hotel, not in Boston or New York or even this growing city of Denver, but in some village in southern Colorado, barely a smudge on the map.<br><br>"Come now. Not all Americans are the same." Percy elbowed Garrick and nodded toward two ladies rising from their seats on the lower platform.<br><br>After taking a few steps, the stylishly dressed young misses turned to glance toward Garrick and Percy before moving toward the train. Something struck Garrick's midsection, and he looked down to see if Percy had hit him. No, the shock was entirely internal and caused by the exquisite girl in the lavender traveling suit and matching hat. Her stunningly beautiful countenance bespoke an English heritage: a porcelain complexion framed by shiny dark brown hair upswept in an attractive coiffure. Her elegant posture and carriage suggested she might very well be used to gracing London's finest drawing rooms. If propriety didn't prohibit his addressing her, he'd step forward straightaway and introduce himself.<br><br>"Did you see her?" Percy sounded breathless. "Have you ever seen a more beautiful lady? Why, a man could be tempted to propose on the spot based upon her looks alone."<br><br>Garrick huffed out a sigh. Of course Percy was joking, but with fortune enough to last beyond a lifetime, he could well afford to consider marriage. Conversely, Garrick had lost all such expectations at the age of nineteen when his childless widowed uncle had remarried. His young bride had borne him three healthy sons in his old age. Yet hadn't Garrick himself encouraged Uncle to remarry in his loneliness? That was as it should be.<br><br>However, at the age of twenty-five, instead of anticipating an inheritance of title, wealth and lands, Garrick had been forced to revise his expectations and work for his living. He wouldn't mind so much if he didn't also have to provide for Helena's dowry. His younger sister must make a good match even if Garrick never could.<br><br>"Yes, she's quite lovely." A melancholy twinge stung inside his chest. Though it would be ill-advised, Percy could pursue the young beauty if he liked. Garrick could only admire her from afar. Or he could redirect his cousin's attention. "Her companion is rather pleasant looking. Perhaps her ginger hair denotes an Irish heritage."<br><br>"It's the redhead I admire, cousin." Percy laughed in his merry way. "As it appears we'll be on the same train, it's a shame we've no one to introduce us. What a jolly chat we could have with them as we travel."<br><br>Profound relief flooded Garrick's chest. Which was ridiculous, of course. Even though they fancied different girls, as Percy said, they had no proper way to meet them. Nor would it be wise to do so.<br><br>A piercing whistle cut short his thoughts as a westbound train approached on the second track. Garrick glanced toward it and saw a small child, one belonging to the harried young mother, toddle after a red ball between the tracks. Did no one closer see? Driven by horror, Garrick plunged down the steps and through the crowd, using his walking cane to move people aside. Others now saw the danger and cried out.<br><br>Garrick dashed onto the track and snatched the child back moments before the great black engine chugged into the station, steam blasting from its undercarriage. He restored the toddler to his hysterical mother. Beside her, a teary-eyed lad of perhaps fourteen years held a small girl.<br><br>"Thank you, sir. I didn't see Jack wander off." He stuck out a grimy hand. "I'm Adam Starling."<br><br>"How do you do, Adam?" Moved more than he cared to admit, Garrick shook the lad's hand. Clearly he endeavored to be the man of the family. Garrick knew very well the problems faced by an eldest son. As others congratulated him, he brushed past them. His train would depart momentarily, and he must drag Percy from his stupor induced by watching the scene. Poor chap. He always hesitated in times of crisis. Perhaps on this trip he'd learn to be a bit more aggressive.<br><br>"We should board." Garrick nudged his cousin's arm.<br><br>"I say, old man, brilliantly done." Percy walked beside him toward the first-class coach. "Nothing short of heroic."<br><br>"Nonsense." Garrick hated such praise. If he were a true hero, he'd have saved another Jack five years ago. The hapless village boy had sunk beneath the black surface of Uncle's lake before Garrick could reach him. His lifeless body was found in a marsh days later and returned to his widowed mother. If only Garrick could have reached him.<br><br>Remorse wouldn't restore life to that Jack, but it did spur him to help the less fortunate whenever possible. Besides, if he craved admiration for today's actions, it was from the beautiful young lady in lavender, who'd boarded the train before he even noticed the child's dire circumstances. Too bad she hadn't observed the drama.<br><br>A foolish thought, but a momentary diversion from the unwelcome duties that lay ahead. <i>Lord, help me</i> had been his cry to the Almighty since losing all of his expectations, and would continue to be until his dying day.<br><br>Rosamond Northam waited until she and Beryl Eberly sat down in the first-class coach before venting her indignation. Even when she did, the lessons learned at Boston's Fairfield Young Ladies' Academy didn't fail her.<br><br>"Gracious, what an arrogant man." She spoke in a soft tone, holding back harsher words she'd have used three years ago. Being back home in Colorado, back among her own people, would challenge every lesson she'd learned, especially when a foreigner&#x2014;an Englishman at that&#x2014;criticized her beloved homeland, particularly the state of Colorado.<br><br>"His friend seemed pleasant enough." Beryl spoke wistfully and stared out the window as if searching for the men. "Dignified, too."<br><br>"Don't look for them." Rosamond gently patted Beryl's hand, her heart twisting with concern.<br><br>"I wonder if they'll be on this train." Beryl glanced over her shoulder and gasped softly. "They're sitting back there on the other side. Do you suppose we could meet them?"<br><br>"Shh!" Rosamond sent her a scolding frown. "No, we can't meet them. Why would you want to? If anything, I'd like to show the dark-haired man just how <i>unrefined</i> we can be, as in behaving in our old cowgirl ways, talking loudly with improper grammar." She smothered an undignified giggle and risked a quick look their way. My, the dark-haired man was handsome to a fault. Too bad good manners didn't accompany that well-formed face and physique. "But someone else in this coach may be traveling to Esperanza. Our school's reputation would be ruined before we even build it if we teachers behave in an unseemly fashion."<br><br>Beryl's face lit briefly with humor. "That dandy could use a comeuppance, but I wouldn't wish to offend his friend." She settled back in the leather seat and gazed out the window again.<br><br>Rosamond's heart ached for Beryl. The middle child in a family of five girls, she'd been every bit a cowgirl like the rest of them until she had been shot during a bank robbery and almost died. Rosamond and the five Eberly girls had grown up riding, shooting, branding&#x2014;anything a cowboy did. But Rosamond's family had three grown sons and a passel of hired hands to tend to the many duties around Four Stones Ranch, so her parents agreed to her dream to build a high school for Esperanza. With the Lord's blessing, they could construct the school this summer and open it in September. Rosamond hoped Beryl's parents would let her teach rather than return her to ranching.<br><br>A well-dressed older couple took the two seats facing the girls. On the trip across the country, other such couples and matrons had offered themselves as chaper-ones, and these two did the same, engaging Rosamond and Beryl in conversation and keeping at bay undesirable men. The lady smelled of rosewater just like Mother, and the gentleman of cherry tobacco like Father. What pleasant reminders of home. Upon the couple's arrival, Rosamond saw Beryl relax a little. Perhaps her interest in meeting the young man was generated by a desire to feel safe. Rosamond could find no fault in that. Maybe the Lord would make a way for Beryl to meet the nicer Englishman, hopefully without his arrogant friend nearby to crush her spirits.<br><br>For her own part, at twenty-one, she'd given up on romance. None of the eligible men she'd met in Boston had found her personal ambitions compatible with their need for a docile Society wife. Nor did she wish to assume the many responsibilities of a rancher's wife. Without doubt, God called her to educate the youth of Esperanza; therefore, she'd be a spinster.<br><br>The train chugged out of the station and rumbled southward along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, where the morning sun illuminated snowy peaks. Rosamond drank in the beloved sights of her home state.<br><br>Later they passed Pikes Peak, and in time her beloved Sangre de Cristo Range came into view. Her heart skipped. She would arrive home in just one more day.<br><br>After a night in a Walsenburg hotel, Rosamond and Beryl boarded the westbound train for their last day of travel. Rosamond sat on the aisle in the middle of the car and whispered to Beryl. "Don't look now, but those sissified Englishmen boarded after us." She nodded toward the closed window. "You can see their reflections."<br><br>Beryl's face brightened for the first time since they'd awakened that morning. The closer they traveled toward home, the bleaker her mood. Too bad a handsome foreigner was the one to cheer her. To Rosamond's dismay, her friend did turn. And look. And smile!<br><br>"Tst!" Rosamond kept her voice low. "Don't do that. Remember our lessons in deportment. It just isn't done."<br><br>"I know." Beryl sighed. "He started to tip his hat, but his friend stopped him."<br><br>"What?" Rosamond glanced back at the other man. He tilted his head, and surprise crossed his well-formed countenance. He seemed about to smile. With a haughty sniff and lift of her chin, she faced the front. That snob kept his friend from showing a common courtesy to a tender soul like Beryl and then attempted to flirt with <i>her.</i> The very idea!<br><br>The train moved forward, and Rosamond's heart skipped. They'd be home by midafternoon.<br><br>"Let's talk about our plans." She must divert Beryl's attention from the Englishmen. Although they'd exhausted just about every subject during their long trip, she never tired of her favorite one. "I'm thankful Father's already approved the building of the school, but I hope he'll let me supervise its construction."<br><br>"Aren't four classrooms too many?" Beryl chewed her lip, and Rosamond reminded her with a quick shake of her head to stop that bad habit. "With only the two of us teaching..."<br><br>"I'd really like more rooms, but I think four is a good start." Rosamond's heart raced. Soon she'd put her ideas to work. "We'll need to hire more teachers before you know it. Maybe we should build two stories from the outset."<br><br>Beryl nodded absently. From the way she kept turning her head to the side, Rosamond knew she wanted to look back at the blond man. If propriety didn't dictate otherwise, she'd have made sure her friend met him before the train reached Esperanza simply to annoy his companion. She quickly dismissed the thought. She'd put aside such spitefulness seven years ago when she'd become a Christian. How could she ask the Lord to bless her endeavors when her behavior didn't show His love to others? Even to rude Englishmen.<br><br>The train began to build up speed for the ascent to La Veta Pass. Rosamond always found this part of the trip exhilarating. Soon they'd be in the midst of the Sangre de Cristos. As a token of promise, fresh, crisp air seeped into the car beneath its front door and around the windows. She inhaled a long, satisfying breath and smiled in anticipation of seeing her dreams come true.<br><br>The moment the train began to accelerate, however, it slowed to a halt, the wheels squealing in protest against the iron rails.<br><br>"Wake up, Abel." A woman of perhaps thirty years, seated up front and facing the rest of the car, shook her sleeping husband. "Something's wrong." Abel slept on, clearly unconcerned, his head resting back against the front wall, arms crossed, legs stretched out and a wide-brimmed hat pulled over his face.<br><br>Beryl grasped Rosamond's arm. "Why are we stopping?"<br><br>"Shh. There, there." She patted Beryl's hand. "I'm sure it's fine. Probably something on the tracks.

Bly's commentaries are succinct and insightful, and 17 stark black-and-white woodcuts complement the text. The selections are divided into five categories, each centering upon a stage of Thoreau's philosophy. The book operates at several levels, serving as an introduction for those new to Thoreau's works and as a powerful additional book for the many who already cherish the work of this New England rebel.

Then something happens to turn the waiting room into a kerfuffling scramble of paws, a tangle of bodies and a jumble of jaws . . . what can be the matter? Another rumbustious, rhyming romp with Hairy Maclary (from Donaldson&#39;s Dairy!) and friends! Lynley Dodd is an award-winning author/illustrator who lives in New Zealand. She is enormously popular for her rhyming stories of the unforgettable HAIRY MACLARY and his friends. She worked as a teacher before beginning to write her own books in 1974.

She went on to teach art before taking a break to start a family. She began to work as a freelance illustrator and collaborated with author Eve Sutton on My Cat Likes to Hide in Boxes. There was no looking back as Lynley went on to write and illustrate her own books for children. Exuberant artwork and bouncy rhymes come together perfectly in books like Slinky Malinki and Hairy Maclary from Donaldson&#39;s Dairy. As well as being a visual delight, these are some of the most rewarding books for children and adults to read out loud.PreSchool-Grade 1-- Hairy Maclary, a small black dog, has his tail nipped by a caged cockatoo and, leaping up, precipitates a lighthearted pet riot in the veterinarian's waiting room. Lively watercolor and ink illustrations are carefully coordinated with a brief, rhymed text. Realistic yet simplified paintings completely fill each left-hand page and face a right-hand page devoted exclusively to text. The animated feeling of these paintings is derived more from expressive animal faces than from a sense of motion. The animals are well observed and neatly individualized. The use of language is delightful, being musical, playful, and colorful. The print is large and appropriate for beginning readers, but the vocabulary may prove intimidating to those same readers. This reads aloud well; however, previous books about Hairy Maclary are stronger as this story is a bit muddled. The vet enters to restore peace to her waiting room, but it is never clear that she succeeds before the punchline, which indicates that the rumpus is about to start anew. --Cynthia Bishop, Onondaga County Public Library, Syracuse, NY<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Lost Get-Back Boogie</h2><p>Recently paroled from prison, Ivy Paret settles in with fellow ex-convict Buddy Riordan and Riordan&#39;s family on a sprawling ranch in Montana and becomes drawn into a tragic conflict involving the family and their neighbors</p><p><p>James Lee Burke is the author of twenty-three novels and one collection of short stories. Two books, Heaven's Prisoners and Two for Texas, were adapted as motion pictures. Over the years, he has also worked as a pipeliner, land surveyor, social worker, newspaper reporter, and creative writing teacher. A native of Houston, he grew up on the Louisiana-Texas coast and now divides his time between New Iberia, Louisiana, and Missoula, Montana.</p><p>Christine Wiltz, a native New Orleanian, is the author of three mysteries featuring the Irish Channel detective Neal Rafferty, the novel Glass House, and the nonfiction work The Last Madam: A Life in the New Orleans Underworld. She co-wrote and -produced the PBS documentary Backlash: Race and The American Dream, about David Duke and his followers, which aired at the time of the gubernatorial runoff between Duke and Edwin Edwards.</p>This wonderful novel about a Korean War veteran released in the '60s from a Louisiana prison farm where he served a term for manslaughter is neither roman tic nor cynical in its realism. Loner Iry Paret, a country-and-western musician, has survived two years of hacks, trustees and dangerous inmates, not with hope but with a dull, gloomy attentiveness that has written hardship's effects all over him. Once he is paroled, he drinks liquor as if it were a tonic, but even drinking brings no joy. He travels to a fellow prisoner's ranch, and as he heads west, the air clears. His involvement with his acid-dropping pal Buddy Rior dan, Buddy's stoical ex-cowboy father (who feuds with a foul-odored pulpmill) and Buddy's estranged wife, Beth, tugs him between adjustment to straight life and the battles that may send him back to jail. Although the ending strays, this latest novel by the author of The Convict is pensive and cautiously paced. It also contrasts two very different parts of the essence of Americathe hazy bayou and a resolute valley in the beautiful West. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cinnamon Gardens</h2><p>Set among the upper classes in the gracious, repressive and complex world of 1920s Ceylon (Sri Lanka), this evocative novel tells the story of two people who must determine if it is possible to pursue personal happiness without compromising the happiness of others. A young teacher, Annalukshmi, whose splintered family attempts to arrange an appropriate marriage for her, must decide whether the independence she craves will doom her to a life without love and companionship. It is also the story of Balendran who, respectably married, must suppress-or confront-the secret desires for men that threaten to throw his life into chaos. With sensuous atmosphere and vivid prose, this masterfully plotted novel re-creates a world where a beautiful veneer of fragrant gardens and manners hides social, personal, and political issues still relevant today.<br></p><p>Set in 1920s? Ceylon, during the turbulent closing days of colonial rule, this evocative story of intertwined lives takes us behind the fragrant gardens and polished surfaces of the elite who reside in a wealthy suburb of Colombo to reveal a world of splintered families, conflicted passions, and lives destroyed by class hatred. Annalukshmi, a spirited young schoolteacher, finds herself caught between her family?s pressures to marry and her own desire for a more independent life. Then there is her uncle Balendran, whose comfortable life of privilege is rocked by the arrival of Richard, a lover from his past. Their uneasy reunion re-ignites tensions with Balendran?s powerful father, and threatens all on which Balendran has built his present life.

He and Pam live in Manhattan, with their two cats (actual, real ones).*Starred Review* Followers of premier underground comics creator Deitch's long career know how hopeless it's been for him to expunge Waldo, the evil blue cat that only he and other deranged characters can see, from his cartooning--and his life. The malignant feline bedeviled the hero of <i>The Boulevard of Broken Dreams</i> (2002), and Deitch's new book concerns several others so cursed, Deitch himself foremost among them. He and his wife are inveterate collectors of pop-cultural detritus. Her passion for cat kitsch and his for silent movies intersect when they find, buy, and mysteriously lose a (gulp!) Waldo doll, and, thanks to her winning an eBay auction for an ancient cat costume, he then discovers a 1915 comic-strip-and-movie serial, left incomplete by its creator's bizarre death. The costume was worn in the film version, in which the shadow of cat ears--Waldo's ears!--fleetingly appears. In the final, third episode of a wild ride punctuated by wilder side trips to fill in the backstory, Deitch repairs to Midgetville, New Jersey, to face down his nemesis. He does not emerge unscathed. Deitch's parody of the hard-boiled sleuther is gloriously ludicrous yet as involving as a Philip Marlowe caper, and his boldly cartoonish artwork, packed with ambient detail and full of blockish, weighty figures (they could all be heavies), is the perfect medium for it. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Less well known is the fact that the winery features a private dining room to rival the best restaurants in the Napa Valley. Here in the Vineyard Room, innovative chef Annie Roberts brings a refined sense of taste and balance to her creations, always designed with the perfect wine in mind. The winery is also home to elegant music and art events, all planned to perfection by Annie's mother, Margrit. And so a mother and daughter come together to deliver a wine country experience like no other. In ANNIE AND MARGRIT, renowned cookbook author Victoria Wise shares behind-the-scenes stories of Annie and Margrit's collaboration over time, along with Annie's fabulous recipes, reflecting treasures and traditions from her mother's cooking and influences from life in the Napa Valley. From the start, Margrit and Annie cooked with one another, Annie learning at Margrit's stove. Years later, Annie became the first executive chef of a winery in the Napa Valley, and developed a repertoire including Squab with Cabernet Sauvignon&#x2013;Onion Marmalade and Spatzli; Salmon Fillets with Whole Grain Mustard Beurre Blanc; Poussins with Swiss Chard Gratin; and Fresh Plum Galette. ANNIE AND MARGRIT takes you inside the Mondavi experience, evoking the tastes, sights, and sounds of a day's visit to the winery. Recipes and stories from the daughter-mother team of Annie Roberts and Margrit Biever Mondavi, who collaborate on the food and cultural events at the Robert Mondavi Winery. Features full-color photography of the Napa Valley, as well as styled food shots. Includes over 130 recipes. An ideal gift for Mother's Day, or for mothers and daughters to give to each other for any occasion.</p><p>VICTORIA WISE was the first chef at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, and created Pig-by-the-Tail, the first American French-style deli. She went on to become the acclaimed author of twelve cookbooks. Victoria lives with her family in Oakland, California.<br>MARGRIT BIEVER MONDAVI is Vice President, Art and Culture at the Robert Mondavi Winery. She joined the winery in 1967, pursuing a life-long interest in uniting wine with fine arts, music, and culinary artistry. She married Robert Mondavi in 1980; they live in the Napa Valley. <br>ANNIE ROBERTS is the Executive Chef at the Robert Mondavi Winery. Her cuisine has been showcased in the winery'�?s Vineyard Room since 1974. Annie and her husband, Keith, live in Santa Rosa, California.Although it can't escape a certain air of privilege (where but in Napa would you assume everyone can get hold of Dungeness crab, microgreens and flageolet beans), this earnest book emphasizes the relationship of Roberts and Biever Mondavi and their fresh, surprisingly global cuisine. Swiss-born Mondavi, the winemaker's wife, spent an army childhood roaming the globe, which explains why Chilled Udon Noodles with Shrimp and Shiitake Mushrooms rubs shoulders with Tajine of Poussins with Aubergine. Her daughter, Annie (from a previous marriage), contributes an earthy appreciation of the Mediterranean ingredients so thoroughly domesticated in California. Roberts and Biever Mondavi offer a handful of delicious and relatively simple home-style dishes, like Rock Shrimp Gazpacho and Winter Apple Tart; some of the recipes are more labor intensive, however, like Lobster Tartlets with Leek and Fennel Confit, Haricots Verts and Lobster Sauce or the julienned purgatory of Halibut with Vegetable Confetti and Scallop Sauce. Though the title promises "stories" from the kitchen, few can be found outside the brief introduction. Nevertheless, with its cleanly styled cuisine and artfully composed photographs of mother and daughter at work, this is a heartfelt cookbook that exudes all the peaceful luxury one associates with the wine country experience. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Greenberg&#39;s Guide to Lionel Trains 1901-1942: Volume II</h2><p>Provides a comprehensive listing with current prices of Lionel locomotives, rolling stock, and accessories in models made from 1901 through 1942</p><p></p><h2>Expeditions Unpacked: What the Great Explorers Took into the Unknown</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A fascinating and unique look at these celebrated expeditions.

But the greatest test of their courage and friendship will come from an enemy more cunning than any they&#39;ve known before--a bear who is the undisputed king of the wilderness, a savage killer called Old Majesty.Jim Kjelgaard spent his boyhood in country much like that described in this book. &#34;Those mountain farms&#34;, he remembers, &#34;produced more rocks to the acre than anything else. But they provided my brothers and me with plenty of ammunition for fighting the neighboring boys across the creek. One of our jobs was to shoo the cows out of the corn patch, which was more exciting than it sounds. There were always two or three yearling bulls in the dairy herd, and when we wanted to get home quickly, we&#39;d each grab one by the tail. The bulls would light out for the barn, their feet hitting the ground about every two yards, and ours in proportion. But the really entrancing thing was the forest that surounded us: mountains filled with game, and trout streams loaded with fish.&#34; Jim&#39;s first book was &#34;Forest Patrol&#34;, based on the wilderness experiences of himself and his brother, a forest ranger. &#34;Big Red,&#34; &#34;Irish Red,&#34; and &#34;Outlaw Red&#34; are dog stories about Irish setters.</p><h2>The Campaigns of Alexander</h2><p><p>� His passion was for glory only, and in that he was insatiable&#x2019;</p> <p>Although written over four hundred years after Alexander&#x2019;s death, Arrian&#x2019;s <b>Campaigns of Alexander</b> is the most reliable account of the man and his achievements we have. Arrian&#x2019;s own experience as a military commander gave him unique insights into the life of the world&#x2019;s greatest conqueror. He tells of Alexander&#x2019;s violent suppression of the Theban rebellion, his total defeat of Persia, and his campaigns through Egypt, India and Babylon &#x2013; establishing new cities and destroying others in his path. While Alexander emerges from this record as an unparalleled and charismatic leader, Arrian succeeds brilliantly in creating an objective and fully rounded portrait of a man of boundless ambition, who was exposed to the temptations of power and worshipped as a god in his own lifetime.</p> <p>Aubrey de S�lincourt&#x2019;s vivid translation is accompanied by J.

The edition also includes maps, a list for further reading and a detailed index.</p> <p>�&nbsp;</p></p><p>Although written over four hundred years after Alexander&#39;s death, Arrian&#39;s &#39;Campaigns of Alexander&#39; is our best source of knowledge of the man and his deeds. Arrain had himself been a military commander, and his record of the exploits of the world&#39;s greatest conqueror reveals sympathy for his subject, without the adulation or contempt which so often mar other histories of the time. Arrain&#39;s unaffected style of writing, with its matter-of-fact tone, offsets the remarkable career and paradoxical nature of Alexander, giving us a fair, clear report about a man who was worshipped as a god in his own lifetime.<b>Arrian</b>, or Lucius Flavius Arrianus, was a Greek born of well-to-do parents at Nicomedia, the capital of the Roman province of Bithynia, probalbly a few years before A.D. 90. His father had been granted Roman citizenship which enabled Arrian to take up his career in the imperial service. In about A.D. 108 he studied philosophy under Epictetus and wrote down his sayings in the Discourses, and a summary of his teachings in a Manual. His imperial advancement was rapid, and in A.D. 129 or 130 he achieved the consulship. But it was his appointment as governor of the border province of Cappadocia a year later which shows how greatly the Emperor Hadrian trusted his undoubted military and administrative abilities. His command included two Roman legions and numerous auxiliary troops, a rare, perhaps unexampled, responsibility for a Greek at that time. In A.D. 134 he drove the invading Alans out of Armenia in a campaign he describes in <i>The Formation</i> against the Alans. He also wrote a <i>Tactical Manual</i> for cavalry, and the <i>Circumnavigation of the Black Sea</i>, an account of the voyage he undertook from Trapezus to Dioscurias in 131-2. He retired or was recalled before the death of Hadrian in 138, and devoted the rest of his life to writing, living at Athens. He became an Athenian citizen and rose to be chief magistrate in 145, which qualified him to become a member of the Areopagus, the chief governing body of Athens. Nothing further is known for certain of his life. The surviving works of Arrian's Athenian period are a handbook,<i> On the Chase</i>, <i>The Campaigns of Alexander</i> in seven books, and the <i>Indica</i>, an account of the voyage of Alexander's fleet form India to the Perisian Gulf.<br><br><b>Aubrey de S�lincourt</b>, scholar and translator, translated Livy&#x2019;s <i>The Early History of Rome</i> (Books I&#x2014;V) and <i>The War with Hannibal</i> (Books XXI&#x2014;XXX),<i> The Histories</i> of Herodotus and <i>The Campaigns of Alexander</i> by Arrian, all for the Penguin Classics. He was born in 1896 and educated at Rugby, and University College, Oxford. A schoolmaster of genius for twenty-six years, he retired in 1947 to the Isle of Wight, where he lived until his death in 1962.</p><h2>The Primal Feast: Food, Sex, Foraging, and Love</h2><p>Science writer and naturalist Susan Allport takes readers on a passionate investigation of how the quest for food shapes our destinies and how our preferences for food were formed. In an engaging mix of in-depth research and personal anecdotes, the author of <b>A Natural History of Parenting</b> presents a delightful feast of facts and reflections on how food affects the lives of every creature, from forest animal to dining room gourmet. How does the gray squirrel find the nuts it buried months earlier? How do Inuit hunters outwit ever-vigilant seals? How do animals manage to consume a healthy mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats? What is the connection between food and love, food and intelligence, food and sexuality?<br>Chronicling habits of collecting, storing, and consuming food, in parts of the world as different as the Arctic and her own wooded backyard, Allport untangles the links of the food chain, explains how animals learn which plants and animals are safe to eat, and probes connections between food sharing and human evolution, and between food and reproduction. Along the way she examines the habits of chimpanzees, howler monkeys, hummingbirds, and koalas, among a host of other mammals, insects, and birds.<br>By exploring food as both sustenance and power in societies of hunter-gatherers, Susan Allport reveals important aspects of the human experience that affect us every day. In doing so, she reminds us that food is more than just nourishment: It is a key to understanding the biological universe and a fundamental and essential part of the quality of our existence.</p><p>"For anyone who has puzzled over where and how we humans fit into the world of critters -- and who has not? -- Susan Allport's beautifully written work <b>The Primal Feast</b> offers a banquet of connections, from the foraging habits of murre seabirds in the Arctic to the feeding strategies of chimpanzees in equatorial Africa. The hungers and cravings of human and animal natures have seldom been so clearly and cunningly interwoven, with deep care for the world they share." -- Betty Fussell, author of <i>My Kitchen Wars</i><br><br>"Susan Allport's <b>The Primal Feast</b> is a splendid excursion into the intricacies of survival faced by Earth's creatures. It provides enough intellectual fodder to keep a reader chewing for weeks, not the least of which is her speculation that our amazingly efficient species will be able to temper its fierce urge to propagate and dominate all other species, that we will, as she puts it, 'learn how to share the planet' with its other less formidable denizens." -- Nelson Bryant, columnist, <i>The New York Times</i><br><br>"Once again, Allport makes it stunningly clear that we can't understand human behavior without understanding animal behavior -- and our place in the animal world." -- Catherine Crier, broadcast journalistSusan Allport's previous books include <b>A Natural History of Parenting</b>, <b>Sermons in Stone</b>, and <b>Explorers of the Black Box</b>.

An opportunist and cutthroat careerist from way back, Beria was a police informer in his youth and later spied on the Mensheviks for the Bolsheviks. From an underling of the other Caucasian party chiefs, he then became head of the Georgian GPU, eventually rising to Stalin&#39;s right-hand minister for internal repression and international espionage. Wittlin claims that Beria actually murdered Stalin, who was, as is generally accepted, on the point of a new purge which would have included Beria. As for Beria&#39;s own death, Wittlin notes the various conflicting versions, but foregoes choosing among them. The book is flawed in several ways. Wittlin makes flat statements about all sorts of facts, circumstantialities, and attitudes -- e.g., usually citing anonymous exiles or unreliable sources like David Dallin. Small inaccuracies and overstatements of uncertainties abound (Zhdanov&#39;s possible heart condition, details about Trotsky&#39;s assassin, etc.). There is also a heavy sprinkling of anti-Communist canards about Lenin, the November Revolution, etc. Too much time is spent reconstructing the particulars of Beria&#39;s abductions, rapes and murders of young girls. And most regrettably the book tends to settle for a string of superficially recounted crimes and purges without sufficiently enlarging our understanding of Stalin&#39;s relations with the bureaucracy and its changing faces.</p><p></p><h2>One Woman&#x2019;s Work: The Visual Art of Celia Laighton Thaxter</h2><p>Author, independent researcher, and Thaxter enthusiast Sharon Paiva Stephan presents a visual feast of full-color images highlighting the art of Celia Thaxter. Much attention has been focused on this celebrated author's poetry and on her life as a literary figures and artist whose family maintained a resort hotel on the Isles of Shoals. One Woman's Work focuses on a relatively unexplored facet of Thaxter's gifts: her hand-illustrated books, watercolors, and painted china.<br><br>The Appledore Island hotel became an artists' retreat in the summer. Celia's own artistic inspiration was drawn from the natural objects that surrounded her on the remote islands off the coast of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Her hand-painted china, illustrated poems, and paintings helped earn much-needed financial support for her family, and also provide the backdrop for Stephan's theory that "art was Celia's passion."

These jewels of neon and bright colors remained frozen in time until recently; now, a substantial number have been demolished and many that remain face an uncertain future.&nbsp; Determined to preserve them, photographer Mark Havens has captured their unique style over 10 years, sometimes shooting motel facades while workers were demolishing the backs. With essays by Joseph Giovannini and Jamer Hunt and evocative photographs, <i>Out of Season</i> celebrates the architecture of a bygone era of Jersey Shore summers.</p><p><b>Mark Havens</b>&#x2019;s photographs have been published and exhibited internationally.

In 2001 she was awarded the Jerusalem Prize for the body of her work.<b>Where the Stress Falls</b><br><b>READING</b><b>A Poet's Prose</b><b>"I</b> <b>WHO WOULD BE</b> nothing without the Russian nineteenth century ... ," Camus declared, in 1958, in a letter of homage to Pasternak--one of the constellation of magnificent writers whose work, along with the annals of their tragic destinies, preserved, recovered, discovered in translation over the past twenty-five years, has made the Russian twentieth century an event that is (or will prove to be) equally formative and, it being our century as well, far more importunate, impinging.The Russian nineteenth century that changed our souls was an achievement of prose writers. Its twentieth century has been, mostly, an achievement of poets--but not only an achievement <i>in</i> poetry. About their prose the poets espoused the most passionate opinions: any ideal of seriousness inevitably seethes with dispraise. Pasternak in the last decades of his life dismissed as horribly modernist and self-conscious the splendid, subtle memoiristic prose of his youth (like <i>Safe Conduct</i>), while proclaiming the novel he was then working on, <i>Doctor Zhivago,</i> to be the most authentic and complete of all his writings, beside which his poetry was nothing in comparison. More typically, the poets were committed to a definition of poetry as an enterprise of such inherent superiority (the highest aim of literature, the highest condition of language) that any work in prose became an inferior venture--as if prose were always a communication, a service activity. "Instruction is thenerve of prose," Mandelstam wrote in an early essay, so that "what may be meaningful to the prose writer or essayist, the poet finds absolutely meaningless." While prose writers are obliged to address themselves to the concrete audience of their contemporaries, poetry as a whole has a more or less distant, unknown addressee, says Mandelstam: "Exchanging signals with the planet Mars ... is a task worthy of a lyric poet."Tsvetaeva shares this sense of poetry as the apex of literary endeavor--which means identifying all great writing, even if prose, as poetry. "Pushkin was a poet," she concludes her essay "Pushkin and Pugachev" (1937), and "nowhere was he the poet with such force as in the 'classical' prose of <i>The Captain's Daughter</i>."The same would-be paradox with which Tsvetaeva sums up her love for Pushkin's novella is elaborated by Joseph Brodsky in his essay prefacing the collected edition (in Russian) of Tsvetaeva's prose: being great prose, it must be described as "the continuation of poetry with other means." Like earlier great Russian poets, Brodsky requires for his definition of poetry a caricatural Other: the slack mental condition he equates with prose. Assuming a privative standard of prose, and of the poet's motives for turning to prose ("something usually dictated by economic considerations, 'dry spells,' or more rarely by polemical necessity"), in contrast to the most exalted, prescriptive standard of poetry (whose "true subject" is "absolute objects and absolute feelings"), it is inevitable that the poet be regarded as the aristocrat of letters, the prose writer the bourgeois or plebeian; that--another of Brodsky's images--poetry be aviation, prose the infantry.Such a definition of poetry is actually a tautology--as if prose were identical with the "prosaic." And "prosaic" as a term of denigration, meaning dull, commonplace, ordinary, tame, is precisely a Romantic idea. (The OED gives 1813 as its earliest use in this figurative sense.) In the "defense of poetry" that is one of the signature themes of the Romantic literatures of Western Europe, poetry is a form of both language and being: an ideal of intensity, absolute candor, nobility, heroism.The republic of letters is, in reality, an aristocracy. And "poet" has always been a <i>titre de</i> <i>noblesse.</i> But in the Romantic era, the poet's nobility ceased to be synonymous with superiority as such and acquiredan adversary role: the poet as the avatar of freedom. The Romantics invented the writer as hero, a figure central to Russian literature (which does not get under way until the early nineteenth century); and, as it happened, history made of rhetoric a reality. The great Russian writers <i>are</i> heroes--they have no choice if they are to be great writers--and Russian literature has continued to breed Romantic notions of the poet. To the modern Russian poets, poetry defends nonconformity, freedom, individuality against the social, the wretched vulgar present, the communal drone. (It is as if prose in its true state were, finally, the State.) No wonder they go on insisting on the absoluteness of poetry and its radical difference from prose.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>PROSE IS TO POETRY</b>, said Val�ry, as walking is to dancing--Romantic assumptions about poetry's inherent superiority hardly being confined to the great Russian poets. For the poet to turn to prose, says Brodsky, is always a falling off, "like the shift from full gallop to a trot." The contrast is not just one of velocity, of course, but one of mass: lyric poetry's compactness versus the sheer extendedness of prose. (That virtuoso of extended prose, of the art of anti-laconicism, Gertrude Stein, said that poetry is nouns, prose is verbs. In other words, the distinctive genius of poetry is naming, that of prose, to show movement, process, time--past, present, and future.) The collected prose of any major poet who has written major prose--Valery, Rilke, Brecht, Mandelstam, Tsvetaeva--is far bulkier than his or her collected poems. There is something equivalent in literature to the prestige the Romantics conferred on thinness.That poets regularly produce prose, while prose writers rarely write poetry, is not, as Brodsky argues, evidence of poetry's superiority. According to Brodsky, "The poet, in principle, is 'higher' than the prose writer ... because a hard-up poet can sit down and compose an article, whereas in similar straits a prose writer would hardly give thought to a poem." But the point surely is not that writing poetry is less well paid than writing prose but that it is special--the marginalizing of poetry and its audience; that what was once considered a normal skill, like playing a musical instrument, now seems the province of the difficultand the intimidating. Not only prose writers but cultivated people generally no longer write poetry. (As poetry is no longer, as a matter of course, something to memorize.) Modern performance in literature is partly shaped by the widespread discrediting of the idea of literary virtuosity; by a very real loss of virtuosity. It now seems utterly extraordinary that anyone can write brilliant prose in more than one language; we marvel at a Nabokov, a Beckett, a Cabrera Infante--but until two centuries ago such virtuosity would have been taken for granted. So, until recently, was the ability to write poetry as well as prose.In the twentieth century, writing poems tends to be a dalliance of a prose writer's youth (Joyce, Beckett, Nabokov ...) or an activity practiced with the left hand (Borges, Updike ...). Being a poet is assumed to be more than writing poetry, even great poetry: Lawrence and Brecht, who wrote great poems, are not generally considered great poets. Being a poet is to define oneself as, to persist (against odds) in being, only a poet. Thus, the one generally acknowledged instance in twentieth-century literature of a great prose writer who was also a great poet, Thomas Hardy, is someone who renounced writing novels in order to write poetry. (Hardy ceased to be a prose writer. He became a poet.) In that sense the Romantic notion of the poet, as someone who has a maximal relation to poetry, has prevailed; and not only among the modern Russian writers.An exception is made for criticism, however. The poet who is also a master practitioner of the critical essay loses no status as a poet; from Blok to Brodsky, most of the major Russian poets have written splendid critical prose. Indeed, since the Romantic era, most of the truly influential critics have been poets: Coleridge, Baudelaire, Val�ry, Eliot. That other forms of prose are more rarely attempted marks a great difference from the Romantic era. A Goethe or Pushkin or Leopardi, who wrote both great poetry and great (non-critical) prose, did not seem odd or presumptuous. But the bifurcation of standards for prose in succeeding literary generations--the emergence of a minority tradition of "art" prose, the ascendancy of illiterate and para-literate prose--has made that kind of accomplishment far more anomalous.Actually, the frontier between prose and poetry has become more and more permeable--unified by the ethos of maximalism characteristicof the modern artist: to create work that goes as far as it can go. The standard that seems eminently appropriate to lyric poetry, according to which poems may be regarded as linguistic artifacts to which nothing further can be done, now influences much of what is distinctively modern in prose. Precisely as prose, since Flaubert, has aspired to some of the intensity, velocity, and lexical inevitability of poetry, there seems a greater need to shore up the two-party system in literature, to distinguish prose from poetry, and to oppose them.Why it is prose, not poetry, that is always on the defensive is that the party of prose seems at best an ad hoc coalition. How can one not be suspicious of a label that now encompasses the essay, the memoir, the novel or short story, the play? Prose is not just a ghostly category, a state of language defined negatively, by its opposite: poetry. (<i>"Tout ce qui n'est point prose est vers, et tout ce qui n'est point vers est prose,"</i> as the philosophy teacher in <i>Moli�re</i>'<i>s Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i> proclaims, so that the bourgeois can discover that all his life he has been--surprise!--speaking prose.)

You still there? Talk to me, buddy.&#x201d;</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t open my eyes. It was so dark I felt if I did, more light might fall out than enter, sapping what little energy I had left. I remembered having the same sensation once as a kid, when my brother Leo and I had hidden in one of my father&#x2019;s grain boxes in the barn, closed the cover over us and shut out all light and air. Lack of oxygen wasn&#x2019;t the issue, though-we were out of there, pale and laughing too loudly, long before suffocation became a threat. It was darkness that had defeated us-invasive, all absorbing, reaching in through our wide open eyes to extract whatever was keeping us alive. Squeezing my lids shut had been like hanging onto a cliff edge with my fingertips.</p> <p>Which paradoxically made me wonder if suffocation could be a problem here, entombed as I was. Certainly I felt sleepy, which I&#x2019;d heard was one of the signs, but then that counted for cold, too, and God knows I was cold.</p> <p>&#x201c;Joe? We need to know if you&#x2019;re still okay. Give us an indicator at least-hit the transmit button a couple of times if you don&#x2019;t feel like talking.&#x201d;</p> <p>I really didn&#x2019;t. I was talked out&#x2013;talking to them, talking to myself. I wasn&#x2019;t even sure where the radio was anymore. I&#x2019;d shoved it under my coat when I&#x2019;d pulled my arms out of the sleeves to turn my parka into a thermal straight jacket and better preserve my body heat. Besides, assuming I could find it, I doubted my fingers could operate the damn thing. That was probably why they&#x2019;d told me to just hit the transmit button-they were guessing I was almost gone.</p> <p>I thought about that for a moment, which was no mean feat in itself. My mind had been wandering for hours, easily bringing up images of my parents, life on the farm, Leo, times during combat I&#x2019;d thought were the coldest a man could endure.</p> <p>Until tonight.</p> <p>But pondering the here and now was both a challenge and a bore-an impediment to more pleasant things. The vague memory that I hadn&#x2019;t lost the radio at all, but was still holding it in a numb and senseless hand, barely caused a flicker of concern. I was far too busy leafing through my life&#x2019;s album, evoking sunny, warm, open places.</p> <p>And pictures of Gail.</p> <p>I saw her above me, straddling my hips as I lay on the floor, her eyes narrowed, her mouth open just slightly. There was a faint shimmer of sweat on her upper lip as she raised her arms slowly, smoothly, and stripped off her T-shirt.</p> <p>&#x201c;Joe? It&#x2019;s Willy. Hang in there, pal. You croak, they&#x2019;ll nail me for sure. Don&#x2019;t be so goddamned self-centered.&#x201d;</p> <p>What a guy, I thought-always the right word at the right time. What must his parents have been like?</p> <p>I tried retrieving that last image of just seconds ago, remembering only that it had been of something pleasant and warm. I was beginning to feel warm again myself, in fact. At long last.</p> <p>&#x201c;Won&#x2019;t be too much longer,&#x201d; Willy resumed. &#x201c;They say the storm&#x2019;s almost over-at least enough to try another sortie. Give us some kind of signal, though, will you? This playing coy shit is driving me nuts.&#x201d;</p> <p>He&#x2019;d always been an impatient man-always in a hurry and with nowhere to go. Not like Sammie, for example, equally driven but headed straight up the professional ladder.</p> <p>Gail was ambitious, too, although a lot more complicated-one of the reasons we no longer lived together. Not that the love could be diminished-no matter the test.</p> <p>I furrowed my brow, or thought I did. Sam and Willy and Gail and I were becoming blurred in my mind. Maybe there were similarities I&#x2019;d never glimpsed before-he and I sort of stuck in our ways, the two women either using us as anchors, or fighting the pull of our inertia.</p> <p>Surely there had to be more to it than that.</p> <p>The radio spoke again, sounding like the last man to enter a noisy, crowded room-too far off to be understood. And I had too much to ponder anyway.</p> <p>Let it go, I thought. Let me be.</p> (Archer Mayor)</p><h2>Dark lanterns: Secret political societies, conspiracies, and treason trials in the Civil War</h2><p>Klement refutes the past historical theories and shows that such subversive, secret Civil War societies as the Knights of the Golden Circle, the Order of American Knights, and the Sons of Liberty were never much more than paper-based organizations with vague goals and little ability to carry them out.</p><p><p>Frank L.

As he learned from the players around him, Wendel steadily matured into a respected leader.

Years of no-holds-barred, physical play were taking their toll, and soon his greatest competitor wasn&#x2019;t anyone on the ice, but his own body. Every movement brought agony, every shift was a challenge, and every game meant the decision to keep fighting. But as Wendel&#x2019;s body broke down, his resolve only grew.

When you grow up on a family farm like I did, you learn early on that everyone is expected to pull their weight on the home front.<br> <br>Home for us was a grain and cattle farm that covered about a thousand acres when I was born, although we later expanded it to nine thousand acres. Our farm was in Kelvington, a tiny community of nine hundred people roughly 250 kilometres east of Saskatoon. You can&#x2019;t get much more small-town or rural than Kelvington, Saskatchewan. We had everything that any small rural town needs: a grain elevator, bank, post office, credit union, department store, hospital, retirement home, town hall, and, like in every small town in Saskatchewan, a Chinese restaurant. The one we had in Kelvington was called Ning&#x2019;s Caf�. In terms of things to do, the selection was a little more limited. We were big enough to have a motel and a hotel, although the motel was basically just a long strip of property just outside of town. The hotel was in town, and it had the one bar in Kelvington. There was also an auction market, a skating rink, a curling rink, and even a nine-hole golf course. The golf course was easy to find, as it was beside the water tower and the motel.<br> <br>Golf in small-town Saskatchewan was different than what most people are used to. Our course had sand greens&#x2014;oiled sand, to be exact. So, when you were on the green, you had to make a path in the sand just to putt your ball. I golfed on the course often as a kid, and my grandfather later brought the first golf cart to Kelvington. One of the most exciting moments I can remember was when Kelvington hosted the Saskatchewan sand greens golf championship. The tournament was held in different towns each year, and when Kelvington got its turn, believe me, it was a major deal and the whole community came out. That wasn&#x2019;t all that hard, of course. Because we were such a small town, everyone knew everyone in Kelvington; we all moved in the same circles. We only had one public school and one high school, so growing up, I knew every kid in the surrounding area.<br> <br>My dad had been born in Kelvington in the middle of the Great Depression, and he spent his early life there. As a young man in the 1950s, he left town to play junior and minor pro hockey. He signed somewhere different every year, from Moose Jaw to Saskatoon to Philadelphia to Charlotte. Eventually, though, he headed back to Kelvington in his early twenties to work on the family farm. It was good timing, since my mom, who was from Springside, Saskatchewan&#x2014;a town about 150 kilometres away that, if possible, was actually smaller than my hometown&#x2014;had just moved to Kelvington to teach school. They met soon after Dad moved back, and it wasn&#x2019;t long before they were married and starting a family.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t very hard to see where I got my work ethic. My parents, each in their own way, were the people most responsible for shaping me into the man I am today. But while my dad taught me a lot of the skills I would need to get to the NHL, it was my mom who showed me every day how important it is to get along with everyone and anyone around you.<br> <br>Mom made sure we had three square meals a day. I&#x2019;m talking about a hot breakfast, lunch, and dinner, day in and day out. Steak and potatoes (with plenty of bread and butter) was my favourite meal. Of course, growing up on a cattle farm, I had to like that. But it helped that my mom was also a heck of a cook&#x2014;I would have eaten anything she put in front of me. I would often look in the fridge and complain that there was nothing to eat. She could look in the fridge, and the next thing you knew, there&#x2019;d be three different meals sitting on the table. She would be mixing and matching things, and everything would be delicious. She really could cook up a storm.<br> <br>But on a farm, nobody does just one thing. On top of taking care of all of us day to day, my mom was also the one who would run into town for spare parts if something on one of the farm implements broke. That allowed Dad and the hired men to keep working away on one of the many jobs that inevitably needed their attention. There&#x2019;s no question that the hardest-working person on our farm was my mom. She was the head chef, parts runner, and jane-of-all-trades.<br> <br>We hired men during the seeding and harvest seasons&#x2014;the busiest periods of the year for us&#x2014;to get the jobs done in time. One constant was Tim Johnson. He was like family to us growing up. Tim was with us every year, helping out on the farm&#x2014;he even lived in a little bunkhouse on our property. Tim was only ten years older than me. He had dropped out of school and started working for my dad at sixteen, which made him the cool guy in town because he had some money. As a young kid, I really liked Tim because he fixed all the things that we broke before my dad got home!<br> <br>So, depending on what day of the year it was, my mom was cooking three meals for anywhere from five to fifteen people. And that doesn&#x2019;t even count the snacks we might be having at nine or ten o&#x2019;clock in the evening when we had to work all night or the desserts that we got after most meals. You don&#x2019;t grow up on a farm without having good desserts, and they were my mom&#x2019;s specialty. The only bad dessert that she made was Christmas pudding; I hate Christmas pudding.<br> <br>Growing up, I did the usual chores that any farm kid would do. On top of our grain farming, we also had a cow and calf operation. We had two hundred cows that we had to tend to every day. As kids, my brothers and I had to stand by the gates of the cow pen at feeding time and make sure none of them got out while my dad used the tractor to bring in bales of hay and feed for them. It would be minus-25 degrees Celsius outside, and we would be standing still, little kids guarding the entryway against the massive animals around us.<br> <br>Come spring, our big job was tree planting. In Saskatchewan, you created your farmyards by planting trees to mark the border. My dad&#x2019;s philosophy was that by planting fresh trees every year, your yard would always be healthy. So, as the trees that my grandfather had planted fifty years earlier died off, we had to replace them with new saplings to keep the border from thinning out too much. We must have planted thousands of trees on our property over the years. We had two ways of getting the job done. Sometimes we would just dig a big hole and lay the tree in directly by hand. Other times we would put the trees into the ground using a potato planter. I or one of my brothers would sit on the back of the potato planter while the others towed it around with the tractor, and as the planter dug each hole, we&#x2019;d drop the new tree into it. The days were long, but on a farm, even kids do whatever it takes to get the job done.<br> <br>Harvest time was when things were busiest. On the farm, if it wasn&#x2019;t raining during the harvest, you would be working from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. for two weeks in a row. The hired men would pray for rain just so they could have a break. The long hours weren&#x2019;t a choice, though. We had to work quickly to get the crops off the ground, because we never knew how long our window of good weather would last. So, as long as the weather held, we would stay out in the fields. The only thing that would stop us was the dew. The combine didn&#x2019;t work well if there was any moisture in the field, so dew on the crops meant the combine wouldn&#x2019;t thrash well. And even if the dew settled in, it didn&#x2019;t give us much of a break&#x2014;we&#x2019;d just have to work harder and faster once the crops were dry again.<br> <br>At seeding time, the schedule was a little different, but the days were just as long. My dad used to get up at four in the morning and start seeding until the hired men arrived at six. At that point, Dad would go have a nap, and then he&#x2019;d be right back out there, working alongside the others. Everyone got the same amount of sleep in the end, but it meant that more work got done throughout the day.<br> <br>My days weren&#x2019;t all that different from those of other farm families. My brothers and I were the extra help the family needed to get the jobs done. It wasn&#x2019;t pretty or easy, but there were some perks. We all had parts of the farm that we liked best, but everyone knew my favourite thing was to go for a drive. As a young kid, I looked up to the guys who would drive all the machinery around the farm, and seeing them control those powerful machines made me want to do the same.<br> <br>I drove a vehicle for the first time when I was six years old. We had one of those old Datsun pickup trucks with a five-speed stick shift, and it was the first car in which I could reach the pedals with my toes. Before I was ten, I was already driving small farm equipment. Once my dad saw that I was comfortable with the smaller vehicles, he decided to promote me to the bigger machines. One day, just after I&#x2019;d turned ten, Dad told me that instead of coming home after school, I was to pick up our four-speed Ford tractor, which was being repaired at the John Deere dealership in town. It seemed easy enough&#x2014;the machine was just a little bigger than our lawn tractor, and I&#x2019;d driven that plenty of times. The dealership was right near my school in town, so to my dad, it made more sense for me to stop off there and bring the tractor home after school than it did for him to take time off work to head into town and pick it up.<br> <br>I followed my dad&#x2019;s instructions, and after I got out of class, instead of catching the bus like I usually did, I walked to the dealership, grabbed the keys, and started driving the tractor home. My plan was to head through town and stop off at my grandma&#x2019;s house before continuing on home. I didn&#x2019;t realize that my route would take me right past the police station. As soon as I rolled by, one of the cops came flying out of the parking lot with the lights on. He made me pull over, and once he heard my story, he told me he would move the tractor. But when he got behind the wheel, the cop saw that there was more to the machine than he thought, and he realized he didn&#x2019;t have a clue how to drive it. My dad wasn&#x2019;t mad&#x2014;it was his idea, after all. But he also refused to come pick me up. Work on the farm still came first. So I had to wait by the tractor with the cop until my mom came to collect me, the machine, and the ticket I&#x2019;d been given for driving underage.<br> <br>By the time I hit thirteen, I was consistently driving the bigger machines like the tractors, combines, and swathers. It didn&#x2019;t matter whether the engine had five horsepower or five hundred, I loved driving it. It&#x2019;s easier to experiment like that as a kid in a rural community. The population density in Kelvington is next to nothing. So when I was behind the wheel of a car, a five-hundred-horsepower tractor with double wheels in the front and the back, a grain truck, or anything else, I had nothing but space around me.<br> <br>My parents never stopped me from driving. In fact, they encouraged it, because if I could drive, it meant I could work. We had that Ford tractor, along with a Datsun pickup and a smaller Toyota, and often, my mom might send me out to deliver meals to the crews in the field. She would finish the cooking and set it out, and when I got home from school, I&#x2019;d hop in one of the little pickup trucks and take the food out to the guys. Especially at harvesttime, every minute was precious. We were all working from dawn until well after sunset, so we couldn&#x2019;t afford to have everyone walk back and forth from the fields to get their meals. Also, our farm was well spread out. It crossed lots of roads and was scattered around the town. It got to the point where parts of our land were up to twenty-four kilometres away from our house&#x2014;you actually had to drive through town to get from one side of our property to the other. I&#x2019;d leave school in the centre of town and walk home, then turn around and take the food to the crew, cruising along the numbered streets past the school, the post office, and the grain elevator with KELVINGTON stamped on the side. Everyone pitched in; we all knew that we had a role to play if we were going to get the job done.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>I was the second of three sons in our family. My dad, Les, and my mom, Alma, had my older brother, Donn, in 1962. I was born in 1966, and then my younger brother, Kerry, came along in 1968.<br> <br>You would think that three brothers growing up together on a farm would mean there were a lot of fights. But Donn, Kerry, and I never scrapped all that much. I never fought that much in school, either. I tried to never fight, because if my dad ever found out about me scrapping, my punishment at home would be way worse than anywhere else. My mom wasn&#x2019;t any more lenient. She had quit her job as a schoolteacher after I was born, but she still knew the other teachers and had plenty of that teacherly discipline to direct at us. If I did anything bad at school, she would have found out about it real quick. In a small town, you really can&#x2019;t get away with anything; if you do something bad in the morning, everybody knows about it by lunchtime. So I tried to stay out of trouble.<br> <br>That being said, Donn, Kerry, and I still took up a lot of air. When I was growing up, everything happened outdoors. Our house wasn&#x2019;t big enough to play in, so we would get kicked out of the house a lot. And once we were outside, Mom wasn&#x2019;t letting us back in until it was time to eat. I can&#x2019;t blame her&#x2014;it was a small farm home, too small for three boys to be running around in. Also, we weren&#x2019;t the only animals around. We always had family dogs&#x2014;straight farm dogs that lived outside and were never allowed in the house, but when you added them to our mix, I&#x2019;m amazed our mom didn&#x2019;t kick us off the property, let alone out of the house.<br> <br>We had a basement, but it wasn&#x2019;t much more than a cold storage room and the furnace. If we were playing in there, we might as well have been outside. We preferred to be outdoors, anyway. Donn had his own room, but Kerry and I shared a bedroom, so for the two of us especially, being outside meant that there was more room for each of us.<br> <br>We were also lucky that our closest neighbours were also our cousins. Neil, Darryl, and Rory were my cousins, and they were the same ages as me and my brothers. Of course, when I say they were our closest neighbours, they still lived half a kilometre down the road. Still, having them relatively close by was perfect for a sports-crazed kid like me. Whether we were playing three-on-three hockey, baseball, soccer, football, or any other team sport, the six of us could organize games right there without needing anyone else. To this day, I hate hearing the words &#x201c;We have nothing to do.&#x201d; To an outsider, it might have seemed that Kelvington didn&#x2019;t offer much. But to the six of us, it was our entire world, and we couldn&#x2019;t have been happier.<br> <br>Still, rural Saskatchewan isn&#x2019;t known for a whole heck of a lot. The scenery is beautiful, the people are kind, and the farming is nonstop. But one thing it can claim is cold weather. As a kid, I never gave the cold much thought or found it to be that bad. It was just a fact of life. I remember playing a hockey game when I was eight years old in Invermay, Saskatchewan. We were at an indoor rink, but even with a roof and four walls around us, it was minus-40 degrees on the ice. It was just too cold for us to sit on the bench between shifts. So the coaches and refs came up with a system where every player who wasn&#x2019;t on the ice went to the dressing room to keep warm. Every two minutes, the ref would blow his whistle, and both teams would change their ...</p><h2>Little Big Book Of Chills And Thrills (The Little Big Book Series)</h2><p>Offers a collection of scary tales and poems, along with instructions for doing magic tricks, spooky recipes, and information on magical spells, things that are said to be cursed, old superstitions, and other traditional lore.</p><p>From classic ghost stories by Mary Shelley, J.R.R.

During World War II he served in the Second Marine Division of the Fleet Marine Force Pacific. His memoir of hobo life, A Land So Fair and Bright, was also published by Sheridan House. He now lives with his wife in Los Gatos, California.The true story of a boy who went to sea and came back a man. The author, Russ Hofvendahl, was just 15 years old when he talked his way aboard an old-fashioned four-masted schooner, in an effort not only to satisfy a desire to go to sea, but more importantly, to escape the Great Depression and the way it had affected the San Francisco waterfront. The WILLIAM H. SMITH was still in sight of the Golden Gate, when the stark reality of his impetious decision hit him; there would be no exotic destination for him just the remote, icy Bering Sea, and the cod-fishing grounds. It is a story you will not easily put down. (<i>Sailing</i>)<br><br>Those who survived the Depression never forgot it. Veterans selling apples on street corners. Women taking in washing to survive. Children going without lunch. But along with the bitter memories come the sweet. It was a time when a hungry traveler appearing at the back door of a house might get a job, or at least a glass of cold water. A period when the homeless weren't seen as eyesores, but as neighbors who'd fallen on hard times. Campbell attorney Russell L. Hofvendahl remembers those times well. A San Francisco 15-year-old with a strong case of wanderlust and a pressing need of a job he worked on a four-masted schooner, a story he told in 1983's Hard on the Wind. Now, in A Land So Fair and Bright, he tells what happened when he stepped ashore. Hofvendahl liked sailing, a lot. But he didn't much like his new berth as a messman on a Swedish freighter. So, with a friend, he jumped ship in Canada in 1938 and set out to find his fortune working the wheat harvest. At $1 a day, the fortune wasn't there to be found. But what Hofvendahl did discover was life as a Knight of the Road a hobo. Riding boxcars, hitching rides and tramping on foot he crossed the continent twice. In North Dakota he bluffed his way into a job driving a team of horses and almost lost his life. In New York he found a job as a clothes presser, and a romance. Crossing the Southwest, he had to be careful to elude police, railroad thugs and violent drifters. Yet almost everywhere, he found trusting people, willing to help. This is a wonderful tale of one boy's coming of age and a country and a life that may never be again (<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>)</p><h2>Spelling You See Level C: Wild Tales Instructor&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>The &#34;SpellingYouSee&#34; program from Demme Learning is a unique, research-based homeschool spelling curriculum with five levels that follow the developmental stages of language development. Developed by Dr. Karen Holinga, this program allows students to develop spelling skills naturally and at their own pace with the direction and encouragement of the instructor. Relying upon visual memory that&#39;s built through repeated reading and repeated writing, students will learn spelling through short daily activities that integrate copywork, reading, speaking, and listening, rather than relying on rote memorization for weekly tests. Spelling You See Level C: Wild Tales is suggested for a student who knows letter sounds and spells many common words correctly. It is also suitable for readers between the ages of 7 and 10 who struggle with spelling (see the More Information [PDF] for an explanation of each stage). When determining placement, these are questions to ask: Is my student under the age of 10? Can my student comfortably write two or three sentences at a time? The following passage is written at the minimum reading level for Wild Tales. Can your student read it without difficulty? Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep And doesn&#39;t know where to find them. Leave them alone, and they&#39;ll come home, Wagging their tails behind them. This course relies upon teacher instruction and the (sold-separately) Wild Tales Student Workbook Set cannot be completed without this instructor&#39;s handbook. It features the philosophy and overview for the program, frequently asked questions, short instructions that cover individual and multiple lessons, and a weekly activity guide.

With more than 45 square blocks of wonderful hundred-year-old mansions and charming town homes, Old Louisville counts as the largest Victorian neighborhood in the nation. Given that there are more than 1,000 structures in all where generations of families have lived, loved and died, it is not surprising that there might be a ghost or two knocking about in this acclaimed National Register Historic Preservation District. So many so, in fact, that Old Louisville has also gained the reputation as being the most haunted neighborhood in the country. David Domine found this out for himself when he purchased a lovely 1895 chateauesque mansion on Old Louisville's famed Millionaires Row in 1999. A self-proclaimed skeptic, he dismissed rumors of a mischievous resident poltergeist named Lucy when he moved in, but he soon found himself at a loss to explain the disembodied footsteps, mysterious odors and paranormal activity that plagued the old home. Even after unnerving events caused him to flee the home in the middle of the night, Domine tried to come up with rational explanations for the strange occurrences. Gradually, however, he came to accept the possibility of supernatural phenomena and began to dig into the past of the old home known by locals as the Moorish Palace. He eventually came up with a theory as to who or what might be haunting the property, and in the process he was able to uncover a wealth of fascinating history and ghostly tales about his historic neighborhood. <i>Ghosts of Old Louisville: True Stories of Hauntings in America's Largest Victorian Neighborhood</i> chronicles the harrowing events in his own home and discusses the haunted past of other significant structures in the neighborhood. Rich with interesting historical tidbits and vivid architectural descriptions that bring the opulent mansions and charming homes to life, Domine creates an enchanting mood piece as a backdrop for his tales of the paranormal in this unique American neighborhood.</p><p>A trained interpreter in Spanish and German, David Domine earned his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin in 1989 and has completed graduate studies at the Karl-Franzens-Universistat in Graz, Austria, the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of Louisville. Ever the consummate traveler, he has studied and worked in the Philippines, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Austria, and it was in these far-off places that he honed his appreciation for American food and culture. When not translating or writing restaurant reviews for magazines such as <i>Kentucky Monthly</i> and <i>Arts Across Kentucky</i>, he teaches foreign languages at Bellarmine University and Indiana University Southeast. His current projects include his first novel <i>The Wonders of Absinthe</i> and <i>Peter Paul's Kitchen</i>, a seven-act play set in Old Louisville. He is also the author of <i>Adventures in New Kentucky Cooking with the Bluegrass Peasant </i>and <i>Splash of Bourbon, Kentucky's Spirit</i>,&nbsp;also published by McClanahan Publishing House, Inc.A native of snowy, backwoods Wisconsin, David Domine moved to Kentucky in 1993 after more than ten years of study and travel around the world. He immediately fell in love with the state's wonderful old homes and colorful history, and, in 1999, he moved into a spacious chateau-style townhouse on Louisville's legendary Millionaires Row. Little did he know that his penchant for ghost stories would be indulged when he learned the 1895 mansion reportedly came with its own resident haint, that of a mischievous poltergeist named Lucy. After a series of odd occurrences convinced him that there might be some truth to these reports, he started swapping scary tales with Old Louisville friends and neighbors and soon uncovered a unique neighborhood with a haunted past. A year later, he put pen to paper and started documenting many of the supernatural tales and legends that abound in Old Louisville. <p>His first book, <i>GHOSTS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: True Stories of Hauntings in America's Largest Victorian Neighborhood</i>, hit the shelves in the summer of 2005 and became an overnight bestseller. His next book, <i>PHANTOMS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: Ghostly Tales from America's Most Haunted Neighborhood</i>, forms the second of five in a planned series that showcases the unique flavors that make up Old Louisville, an area long-touted as "America's Victorian Gem." His storytelling is unique in that he utilizes everyone's favorite, ghost stories, as a vehicle to convey a tantalizing mix of local lore, history and architecture. Long convinced of the area's untapped potential as a historical and tourist destination, David has come to realize that Old Louisville can now lay claim to the title of the "spookiest" neighborhood in the country as well. Since then, he has been working with other Old Louisvillians to get the word out about the many delights - not just the otherworldly ones - in store for those who come and explore this undiscovered treasure in the heart of the Derby City.</p></p><h2>RG Veda Volume 9</h2><p>Three hundred years ago, a warlord overthrew the Emperor of Heaven and began a cruel and tyrannical reign, but a prophecy foresaw that Six Stars could bring about his downfall, and Yasha is determined to make the prophecy come true.</p><p></p><h2>BLK STALLION&amp;SATAN-PA (Black Stallion (Paperback))</h2><p>When the Black is returned to Alec Ramsey, the whole racing world, including Alec himself, wonders which horse is faster: the great stallion or his son, Satan.</p><p>Satan has won the Triple Crown, yet Alec still misses the Black, who&#39;s living in Arabia with Sheikh Abu Ishak.

It expands to cover new trends in the film industry, technological developments, as well as exhibition platforms. It is concise while also managing to be thorough and cover a plethora of subjects. Not only does it provide a platform for understanding individual film topics, it also helps one understand how different elements of cinema are connected. Talking the talk is an essential part of navigating the film industry, from production to development, and this handbook will equip you with the tools to get where you need to go.� (Sultan Sharrief, Award-Winning Filmmaker/Media Educator)<br> �As cinema&#x2019;s Samuel Johnson, Frank Beaver has thoroughly catalogued the essential terms used in the world of film production and scholarship.

Literature professors at the State University of New York, the authors analyze women's rage and how it can wreak havoc or serve as a wake-up call, drawing on examples from myth, especially vignettes from the story of Medusa, which begin each chapter (the Medea legend also comes up frequently); news events, including Anita Hill's testimony at the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings and the Hedda Nussbaum/Joel Steinberg case; and examples from literature and film. Also discussed are the psychological problems that can result from repressed rage: multiple personality disorder, depression, eating disorders, drug and alcohol dependency, anger at other women and overdependence on men. Covered as well is the rage older women often experience in reaction to a youth culture. Finally, the authors suggest to women how to acknowledge their rage and transform it into energy for positive change.

The party was a bit out of the way, and I almost skipped it, but since I was only in my hometown, New York City, on rare occasions, I figured I might as well get out and see as many of the people I loved as I could. What had brought me here from Los Angeles was the chance to fill in for a month at the New York bureau of the radio show where I was on staff as a reporter. I bolstered my energy for a busy evening of flitting around the city in hyper&#x2013;social butterfly mode&#x2014;a way of life I rarely indulged in anymore.<br><br>The walk from the office on East 47th Street to the party on 66th Street filled me with wonder and made me wistful for this place I loved so dearly. In early autumn, twilight in New York is magical; the sky glimmers and there&#x2019;s energy in the streets. You feel powerful, invincible, as if every gritty bit of the city is yours. I found myself doing a mental trick I hadn&#x2019;t done since I&#x2019;d moved away: reciting the address of my destination while I walked as if it were the lyrics to a song. Two-three-four / East Sixty-sixth Street, I sang to myself over and over again this September evening, the clunky tune mingling with the click-clack of my bright pink &#x201c;comfort&#x201d; high heels. Inevitably, after all that repetition, I would muck up the street number, and I did this time, too. But there was such a crowd in front of one particularly gorgeous old brownstone, I didn&#x2019;t need to check the little slip of paper in my purse to know I&#x2019;d arrived.<br><br>Crazy busy. Some swanky food magazine editor was debuting a new cookbook. Harris had long been a foodie, and in the last few years had broken into writing about all things gourmet. Good for him to be mingling in such well-fed company. Now it seemed I&#x2019;d have to fight a dreaded crowd to find him. How could I be a city person and hate mob scenes?<br><br>As I made my way to the front door, I took a look up the staircase. It was packed with a crush of people. In the thick of it, facing in my direction, was the most handsome man. He had a shock of brown hair and big brown eyes to match. I know it sounds ridiculous, but in that instant, the mob seemed to disappear. Much to my surprise and delight, I saw him looking right back. Not just in my direction, but at me. Our eyes locked, and, even from a distance, I could swear a sort of chemical reaction erupted between us.<br><br>I&#x2019;d read about these celebrated coup de foudres, thunderbolts, where people met and fell in love at first sight. I knew from experience that an instant attraction could be intoxicating&#x2014;and dangerous. As was the impulse to imagine that a momentary connection was something larger. But this thunderbolt felt different. This was a beautiful, instant intensity I&#x2019;d never, ever experienced.<br><br>Practical me prevailed: I had to find Harris. Time was tight. I peeled my eyes away from the handsome stranger and pushed through the thicket of people. After a series of wrong turns, I spotted him holding court in a corner of the room, smiling and gesturing as if he owned the place. Harris was so good at making people feel welcome, connected. Everyone clutched goblets of wine&#x2014;no disposable plastic cups for this crowd. My friend did a round of introductions, and as he got to the end of the group, I was happily surprised to see the man from the staircase.<br><br>&#x201c;Lisa, this is my friend Sebastian I&#x2019;ve been telling you about, who I&#x2019;m going to Asia with next week. You know, for that story I&#x2019;m writing for Gourmet magazine. And Benjamin, this is Lisa, my friend who works in public radio out in L.A.&#x201d;<br><br>He was better looking now that I could see him up close, and there was a warmth about him, an easy friendliness. I felt a bit self-conscious and suddenly a little off-kilter in my pink shoes.<br><br>Long ago, I&#x2019;d been one of those kids who hid under her mother&#x2019;s armpit to avoid looking at strangers. Then I went into the news business. Earning my living posing questions to people I didn&#x2019;t know had cured me of my innate shyness. Confidence was a good quality, one I was happy to have cultivated&#x2014;especially now faced with this handsome man. Right at this instant, though, I found myself feeling unsure about how to proceed. I wanted to say something clever and prophetic, but I couldn&#x2019;t find the words. So I stuck out my hand, and he stuck out his, and we shook. Sebastian asked if I wanted a drink, and I said yes, and he said he&#x2019;d get me one from upstairs, and I said I&#x2019;d go with him, and there we were, presto, in our own conversational bubble. We talked a bit about public radio&#x2014;always reliable upscale cocktail-party chitchat. With everyone captive in their cars, and smart programming in short supply thanks to budget cutbacks and media consolidation, the public-radio audience tuned in with almost cultlike devotion. Personally, I was sick of the news, and tried to avoid it as much as possible. At the same time, I appreciated the attention those commuters paid our show, and was grateful to have a job at a news outlet that had such an enormous, attentive audience. Better than having no audience at all. I&#x2019;d been out of work a number of times, and underemployed, so I knew well what that was like. I also was very aware that in situations like this one, my profession converted into useful social currency.<br><br>Once we had my wine and a refill for him, I started plying Benjamin with questions about his upcoming trip to Asia. He ticked off the itinerary: a swing through Hong Kong, a few provinces in China I had never heard of, two places in India whose names I knew simply because of their tea&#x2014;Assam and Darjeeling&#x2014;and, for a few days, the tiny neighboring Kingdom of Bhutan.<br><br>&#x201c;Ahh. The happiest place on earth,&#x201d; I said. I hoped my being dimly familiar with one relatively unknown country in all of Asia&#x2014;and knowing the factoid that it was purportedly filled with blissfully happy people&#x2014;might impress him. Although I&#x2019;d never come anywhere close to the continent. I wasn&#x2019;t even certain just where on the continent Bhutan was.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he said smiling. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always been curious about this happiness thing and Bhutan. It has to have something to do with the fact that television is banned there, right?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d now exhausted the extent of my knowledge about the obscure little nation.<br><br>&#x201c;Right, although His Majesty did let TV in a few years back,&#x201d; Sebastian said, his smile broadening and his eyes intense. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s still a very happy place. Hey, get a visa and come with us. Harris and I will be your guides.&#x201d;<br><br>What I wanted to say was that I would have driven to the airport and boarded a rocket to another galaxy with this man, whether or not my dear old friend Harris came along as chaperone. We kept talking, but I really don&#x2019;t remember what we said. I was lost in Sebastian.<br><br>Then, a sort of internal alarm rang and jolted him into remembering he was looking for quarters for the parking meter. After I dug a bunch out of my purse and handed them over, I asked the time and discovered that the clock was ticking for me, too. I needed to head to the other side of town for dinner.<br><br>A quick good-bye, and off I ran. The friend I was meeting turned out to be running very late; I sat at the restaurant with his family as he called every five minutes with updates from the traffic jam. Ordinarily this would have annoyed me, but not tonight. Just knowing Sebastian was out there in the world improved my disposition immeasurably.<br>The next day, I sat in our midtown offices trying to motivate myself to research a story about rich young couples who were trading the plush suburbs surrounding New York City for a new crop of multimillion-dollar kid-friendly condo complexes being built right in the heart of Manhattan. With enough money, you could now have a family without disrupting your metropolitan lifestyle. Among other luxuries, like on-staff dog walkers and a wine cellar, these buildings offered concierges to assist the nannies. An email popped into my inbox and saved me from my internal rant about conspicuous consumption and the decline of civilization. The very sight of the man&#x2019;s name made my heart beat faster.<br><br>Dear Lisa:<br><br>It was great to meet you last night. I owe you a drink for all that change you dug up for me. When can you get together?<br><br>&#x2014;Sebastian<br><br>Sebastian and Harris were leaving on their journey in just a few days, and by the time they returned, I&#x2019;d be back home in Los Angeles. I could find a way to see him tonight. My calendar was totally open after work. I liked it that way, and this invitation reinforced why: The most interesting experiences seemed to happen spontaneously&#x2014;just the opposite of how most everything worked in New York City, where every moment had to be planned by the quarter hour, lest you felt as if you might be &#x201c;wasting&#x201d; a bit of your precious time.<br><br>And yet I found myself hesitating to accept this invitation. I&#x2019;d witnessed many a friend as they sabotaged or just plain avoided opportunities out of some sort of unexpressed fear that success or happiness might result. They became riddled with anxiety and self-loathing before they&#x2019;d even sent in that cover letter or gone on that date. Now here I was, similarly paralyzed.<br><br>The voice of this other me politely declined. It was easy to justify not seeing him. We lived on opposite sides of the country; launching into a relationship that was destined to be long-distance was preposterous, a mistake I&#x2019;d made in the past that I&#x2019;d vowed not to repeat. My, I was getting way, way ahead of myself.</p><h2>Trials Of Apollo Bk 1 The Hidden Oracle</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Visit her online at www.martaperry.com.<p>For twenty-nine years, Corrie Grant had thought she'd never know who her father was. Now she knew, and no one would believe her. </p> <p>No one, at this point, was represented by a pair of smooth, silver-haired attorneys with Southern drawls as thick as molasses. They looked about as expensive as this hotel suite, where she sank to the ankles in plush carpeting. The denim skirt and three-year-old sweater she usually wore for her monthly shopping trip had definitely not been right for this meeting. She hadn't known Cheyenne, Wyoming boasted a hotel suite like this. </p> <p>She slid well-worn loafers under her chair and straightened her back. <i>You're as good as anyone,</i> her great-aunt's voice echoed in her mind, its independent Wyoming attitude strong. <i>Don't you let anyone intimidate you.</i></p> <p>"I've already told you everything I know about my parents." Her words stopped one of the lawyers&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp; Courtland or Broadbent, she didn't know which&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;in mid-question. "I came here to meet Baxter Manning." Her grandfather. She tried out the phrase in her mind, not quite ready to say it aloud yet. "Where is he?" </p> <p>"Now, Ms. Grant, surely you understand that we have to ascertain the validity of your claim before involving Mr. Manning, don't you?"</p> <p>Courtland or Broadbent had the smooth Southern courtesy down pat. He'd just managed to imply that she was a fraud without actually saying it. </p> <p>She gripped the tapestry chair arms, resisting the impulse to surge to her feet. "I'm not making any claims. I don't expect anything from Mr. Manning. I just want to know if it's true that his son was my father." </p> <p>Twenty-nine years. That was how long Aunt Ella had known about her mother's marriage and kept it from her. Corrie could only marvel that she hadn't pressed for answers earlier. She'd simply accepted what Aunt Ella said&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;that her mother had come home to Ulee, Wyoming, pregnant, at eighteen. That she'd died in an accident when Corrie was six months old. That her mother had loved her. </p> <p>Pain clutched her heart. Was that any more true than the rest of the fairy tale? </p> <p>The attorneys exchanged glances. "You must realize," one of them began. </p> <p>She shot to her feet. "Never mind what I must realize." Coming on top of the struggle to stretch her teaching salary and the meager income from Last Chance Caf� to pay Aunt Ella's hospital bills and funeral expenses, she didn't think she could handle any further runaround. "I'm done here. If Mr. Manning is interested in talking to me, he knows where to reach me. I'll be on my way." </p> <p>She was halfway to the door when the voice stopped her. "Come back here, young woman."</p> <p>She turned, pulse accelerating. The man who'd come out of the suite's bedroom was older than either of the lawyers&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;in his seventies, at least. Slight and white-haired, his pallid skin declared his fragility, but he stood as straight as a man half his age.</p> <p>"Mr. Manning." It had to be.</p> <p>He lifted silvery eyebrows. "Aren't you going to call me 'Grandfather'?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>He let out a short laugh. "Fair enough, as I have no intention of letting you." He extended his hand to one of the attorneys without looking. The man gave him the copies she'd brought of her mother's marriage certificate and her own birth certificate. </p> <p>"The birth certificate doesn't name a father." He zeroed in on the blank line, his gaze inimical.</p> <p>She'd learned, over the years, to brace herself for that reaction whenever she had to produce a birth certificate. <i>You're a child of God,</i> Aunt Ella would say. <i>Let that be enough for you.</i></p> <p>Not exactly what a crying eight-year-old had wanted to hear, but typical of the tough Christian woman who'd raised her. Ella Grant had taken what life dished out without complaint, even when that meant bringing up an orphaned great-niece with little money and no help. </p> <p>"According to my great-aunt, when I was born after my father died, my mother was afraid her husband's family would try to take me away. Later, she decided that they had a right to know." She kept her gaze steady on the man who might be her grandfather. "<i>You</i> had a right to know. She left for Savannah to talk to you about me when I was six months old. She died in an accident on the trip."</p> <p>An accident&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;that was whatAunt Ella had always said. It was what Corrie had always believed, until she'd been sorting through Aunt Ella's papers after her stroke. She'd found the marriage license and a scribbled postcard, knocking down her belief in who she was like a child's tower of blocks.</p> <p>He made a dismissive gesture with the papers. "Grace Grant never returned to Savannah after my son died." His voice grated on the words. With grief? She couldn't be sure. "If you are her daughter, that still doesn't guarantee my son was your father." </p> <p>Her temper flared at the slur, but before she could speak, one of the lawyers did. </p> <p>"A DNA test," he murmured.</p> <p>Manning shot him an annoyed look. "From what I've learned, that's not likely to be conclusive with the intervening generation gone." </p> <p>"Nevertheless&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;" The lawyer's smooth manner was slightly ruffled. Obviously the attorneys would prefer that he let them deal with this situation. </p> <p>"I have no objection to a DNA test." Why would she, if there was even a chance that it would answer her questions?</p> <p><i>Who am I, Lord? I know I'm Your child, but I have to know more. </i></p> <p>Manning tossed the papers on the table, bracing himself with one hand on its glossy surface. "It doesn't matter. You won't get anything from me in any event." </p> <p>"I don't want anything." That was what they seemed incapable of understanding. "All I want is to know something about my father. Nothing else." </p> <p>His mouth twisted. "Do you really think I'll believe that?" The truth sank in. Manning didn't believe her, and he wouldn't help her.</p> <p>"No, obviously you can't." She wouldn't offer to shake hands. If her father had been anything like this man, maybe she was lucky he'd never been a part of her life. "I can't say it's been nice meeting you, Mr. Manning, but it's been interesting." </p> <p>She turned toward the door again, holding her head high. Aunt Ella wouldn't have expected anything less. But the disappointment dragged like a weight pressing her down, compounding her still-raw grief. </p> <p>"Just a minute." Manning's voice stopped her again. "I have a proposition for you." </p> <p>"Proposition?" She turned back slowly, not sure she wanted to hear anything else he had to say. </p> <p>A thin smile creased his lips. "I won't claim you as a grandchild, understand that. I won't give you anything. But you may come and stay at my house in Savannah for a few weeks." The lawyers were twittering, but he ignored them. "If you mean what you say, that will give you a chance to learn something about my son." </p> <p>"If you don't believe I'm your grandchild, why would you want me there?" She eyed him, wondering what was in his mind. </p> <p>His smile grew a bit unpleasant. "Ever heard the expression, "putting a cat among the pigeons'? I suppose not. Never mind my motives. They are not your concern." </p> <p>"Mr. Manning, we really don't think this is a good idea." Courtland and Broadbent exchanged glances. </p> <p>Manning transferred his grip from the table to the back of the chair, leaning heavily, obviously tiring. "You make the arrangements. She can go now, while I'm still out of town. Lucas will take care of her." </p> <p>"Lucas?" She grasped at the unfamiliar name, trying to make sense of this. </p> <p>"Lucas Santee. He was married to my niece's child. He runs my companies."</p> <p>"The young woman hasn't agreed to go." And the lawyers obviously hoped she wouldn't. </p> <p>"She will." Manning sent her a shrewd glance. "Won't you?" </p> <p>She didn't like his attitude. Didn't like the feeling that he was manipulating her for some reason she couldn't understand. If she acted on instinct, she'd walk right out the door and go back to Ulee. She had plenty there to keep her busy until school started again. </p> <p>But she wouldn't, because if she did, she'd never know the answers to the questions that haunted her. <i>I hope this is what You want, Lord. </i></p> <p>"I'll go," she said. </p> <p>Corrie leaned against the leather seat of the town car that had been waiting at the airport in Savannah. From the window, everything was so much softer, more verdant than she'd expected. Palmettos lined the road, and beyond them she could see rank after rank of tall, straight pines. </p> <p>"Too bad the azaleas are past their prime." The grizzled driver, Jefferson, he'd said his name was, turned from the highway onto a residential street. "I always say you haven't seen Savannah until you've seen it with the azaleas blooming."</p> <p>She watched the city flow by&nbsp;&#x2014;&nbsp;streets lined with cream-colored walls, wrought-iron fences, twisted live oaks draped with silvery Spanish moss. Flowers bloomed everywhere, so lush and colorful they almost looked artificial. The houses seemed to hide behind their colorful barrier, as if holding secrets closed to her.</p> <p>"Does the family live in this section of town?" Jefferson nodded. "Not far. This here's the old part of town." He waved a hand vaguely toward the left. "River Street's over that way. You'll want to see that while you're here. Right now I'm to stop and pick up Mr. Lucas, then take y'all to the house." </p> <p>Corrie's nerves tingled. Manning had said Santee ran his company. What else did he run? Santee obviously intended to vet her before exposing the rest of the family to her. She felt a tingle of apprehension. "Are we picking him up at his office?" </p> <p>"At the construction site. They've been having problems at the new building. Nothing Mr. Lucas can't handle. He can handle anything." </p> <p>That was another view of Lucas Santee. He could handle anything. Maybe the implication was that he could handle her, too. In a moment she'd have a chance to decide for herself just how much of a challenge Lucas Santee was going to be. </p> <p>Thanks to the briefing the lawyers had reluctantly provided, she knew that a number of Savannah businesses bore the Manning name. Lucas Santee ran the largest, the construction firm, and oversaw the rest since Manning's retirement.</p> <p>The driver stopped the car next to a wooden construction barrier. "Here we are, miss. I'll just go find Mr. Lucas." </p> <p>Jefferson disappeared into the construction site, but Corrie was too restless to wait. She was keyed up and ready. The plane trip had been a prelude. Her quest was about to start. She slid out of the car and followed Jefferson on to the construction site. </p> <p>The three stories of what was going to be a new bank, according to the sign, were at the stark girder stage. The building loomed over her, surrounded by heavy yellow construction vehicles.</p> <p>She didn't see Jefferson, so she smiled at the nearest worker. "Where's Lucas Santee?" </p> <p>The man gave her the once-over before pointing to the third level of the building. "Up there. The suit." </p> <p>Actually, Lucas Santee had shed his suit coat, but Corrie understood. The other man was short, round and rumpled in workmen's overalls. Santee's shirt was dazzling white, and his dark slacks had a knife-edge crease she could see from here. He stood confidently on a girder, as self-assured as if he stood in a boardroom. </p> <p>Santee said something that looked emphatic, motioning to the building around him. The other man appeared to object, but Santee cut him off with a quick, definitive gesture.</p> <p>Santee stepped into the open cage of an elevator. With one hand braced against the metal on either side, he descended. Was he looking her way? She couldn't be sure. </p> <p>The cage jolted to a stop, and he stepped out lightly. He took a suit coat from the outstretched hand of one of his lackeys and handed over the yellow hard hat he'd been wearing.</p> <p>Jefferson leaned close, murmuring something, and Santee sent a sharp glance at her before turning back to his men. He kept her waiting a few more minutes while he conferred with several people. Finally he detached himself from the group and started toward the car. He stepped from the shadow of the building, and the late-afternoon sun hit him like a spotlight. </p></p><h2>Depression Era Kitchen Shakers (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>However depressing the Depression Era may have been, the manufacturers of glassware did their best to add color to people&#39;s lives.

Prominent among them were the milk glass spice shakers shown in this book. They are avidly collected today with lithographed (no decals) apples, birds, butterflies, cherries, cattails, dogs, Dutch motifs, flowers, fruit baskets, hats, figures, leaves, Mexican motifs, musketeers, Niagara Falls, sailboats, and more. For Depression glass collectors and shaker collectors alike, this is a valuable addition to the available literature. Hundreds of shakers are presented in 119 beautiful photographs. Prices are provided for each shaker, with check-off boxes to record additions to your collection. This book will delight and inform.</p><p>Barbara E.

Mystery Guild Main.</p><p>Housekeepers are dropping like flies in Chitterdon Fells, where designer and sleuth Ellie Haskell (God Save the Queen!, 1997, etc.) lives with restaurant-owner husband Ben and three-year-old twins. Roxie Malloy, the familys longtime domestic, is moving to London to care for the newborn daughter of her son George and daughter-in-law Vanessaa cousin of Ellies and a famous model with no talent for mothering. Mrs. Malloy has appointed Gertrude Large, a fellow member of the Charwomens Association, to take over her job. After only one unsatisfactory workday at Ellies, Mrs. Large is found dead, fallen from a ladder, at Tall Chimneys, home of sister newcomers Vienna and Madrid Miller, during a meeting of the Hearthside Guild. Ellie was there, as were Clarice Whitcombe, also a newcomer, Brigadier Lester-Smith, and Sir Robert and Lady Pomeroy, among others. Mrs. Larges assignments are now undertaken by Trina McKinley, heiress to Larges considerable assets and girlfriend of neer-do-well Joe Tollings. Joe and his wife Marilyn become leading suspects when Trina is found stabbed to death in Mrs. Malloys kitchen. Theres yet another victim in this absurd scenario as Ellies tireless snooping finally brings her face to face with the killer. Over-the-top plotting that gets no help from a torrent of domestic activities, dull dialogues, and an unrelenting air of chirpiness. Strictly for the authors devoted fans. (Mystery Guild main selection; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Ellie Haskell dons an apron for cover in her latest adventure (following How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams, 1996). Ellie's stalwart helper, Mrs. Malloy, now a relative since her son married Ellie's cousin, gives notice before she leaves the village of Chitterton Fells for London to look after her granddaughter. As a replacement, Ellie enlists Mrs. Large, a fellow member of C.F.C.W.A. (Chitterton Fells Charwomen's Association), who appears distracted and upset on her first day. The following week, Ellie and a neighbor find the charwoman dead from a fall in the neighbor's library. Ellie lines up the help of another C.F.C.W.A. member, but then this woman and, later, another member of the group are found murdered. Mrs. Malloy, now back from London, and Ellie have to do some sleuthing to stop the rampage. Going undercover as a charwoman, Ellie discovers some secrets among the dust bunnies while searching for clues in their neighbors' homes. The house of Haskell, usually at sixes and sevens with each member skittering off on her own agenda, pulls together so that the team of intrepid amateur detectives, led by the redoubtable Mrs. Malloy, can solve the case. Cannell's lively wit and acute insights into marriage, motherhood and murderous inclinations will delight fans as well as readers new to her high-spirited tales.

Now his wife of 15 and a half years, Neile, who rodethe dazzling Hollywood roller coaster with him, revealsA Steve McQueen no one knew - his good side, his crazy side, his dark side . . .</p><p>Penina Spiegel notes in her biography McQueen (reviewed above) that Toffel, McQueen's first wife, informed her about material never before revealed about the late actor. Toffel, however, here presents her own, more intimate story. The affinity between her and her husband was forged by similarly deprived childhoods, she writes; like him, she was neglected by a promiscuous mother. Surviving a Japanese prison camp in the Philippines during World War II, she returned to the U.S. and established herself as a dancer on the Broadway stage in the early 1950s, and then married Steve McQueen. The couple settled in Hollywood, where he rose to stardom. They had two children before their 16-year marriage ended in divorce after McQueen's headlined affair with Ali McGraw. The breakup was the result of her husband's womanizing, public scandals, boozing and drug taking, according to Toffel. Yet she continued to regard him as her friend, she maintains, and they remained bed partners during his later marriages. The book ends with the poignant account of McQueen's death from cancer in 1980. Photos not seen by PW.

Based on a journal kept during his two years at the Senate, the book focuses on three major issues before that body in late April 1983Central America, the federal budget and immigration reformto show how lawmakers and staffers actually function in the "bloated, overburdened, and increasingly polarized" Senate that has emerged in the past decade. Against instructive accounts of the daily rounds of "emblematic" senators (Baker, a Republican from Tennessee; Alan K. Simpson, Republican from Wyoming; and Connecticut Democrat Christopher Dodd) and of aides from other Senate staffs, Miller argues that the Senate is now a "conglomerate" in which younger, bolder members place personal ambitions above party discipline, hindering government and threatening a "legislative crisis." <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Miller portrays the Senate as an institu tion in the "throes of traumatic change." Upon his arrival in Washing ton to become special assistant and chief speechwriter to Senate majority leader Howard Baker, Miller believed the Senate to be "an exclusive club . . . of respected, gray-haired elders . . . who managed the Senate with a common ethos." His experience proved otherwise. The activities of three senators and three staff members during a typical week illustrate a legis lative body that is tremendously over burdened and legislators who are in creasingly self-serving and publicity seeking. A well-written, interesting ac count for both public and academic li braries.

Somebody somewhere is shaking with excitement because something tremendous is about to happen to this person. This person has dressed for the occasion. This person has hoped and dreamed and now it is really happening and this person can hardly believe it. But believing is not an issue here, the time for faith and fantasy is over, it is really really happening. It involves stepping forward and bowing. Possibly there is some kneeling, such as when one is knighted. One is almost never knighted. But this person may kneel and receive a tap on each shoulder with a sword. Or, more likely, this person will be in a car or a store or under a vinyl canopy when it happens. Or online or on the phone. It could be an e-mail re: your knighthood. Or a long, laughing, rambling phone message in which every person this person has ever known is talking on a speakerphone and they are all saying,You have passed the test, it was all just a test, we were only kidding, real life is so much better than that. This person is laughing out loud with relief and playing the message back to get the address of the place where every person this person has ever known is waiting to hug this person and bring her into the fold of life. It is really exciting, and it's not just a dream, it's real.</p><p>They are all waiting by a picnic table in a park this person has driven past many times before. There they are, it's everyone. There are balloons taped to the benches, and the girl this person used to stand next to at the bus stop is waving a streamer. Everyone is smiling. For a moment this person is almost creeped out by the scene, but it would be so like this person to become depressed on the happiest day ever, and so this person bucks up and joins the crowd.</p><p>Teachers of subjects that this person wasn't even good at are kissing this person and renouncing the very subjects they taught. Math teachers are saying that math was just a funny way of saying "I love you." But now they are simply saying it, I love you, and the chemistry and PE teachers are also saying it and this person can tell they really mean it. It's totally amazing. Certain jerks and idiots and assholes appear from time to time, and it is as if they have had plastic surgery, their faces are disfigured with love. The handsome assholes are plain and kind, and the ugly jerks are sweet, and they are folding this person's sweater and putting it somewhere where it won't get dirty. Best of all, every person this person has ever loved is there. Even the ones who got away. They hold this person's hand and tell this person how hard it was to pretend to get mad and drive off and never come back. This person almost can't believe it, it seemed so real, this person's heart was broken and has healed and now this person hardly knows what to think. This person is almost mad. But everyone soothes this person. Everyone explains that it was absolutely necessary to know how strong this person was. Oh, look, there's the doctor who prescribed the medicine that made this person temporarily blind. And the man who paid this person two thousand dollars to have sex with him three times when this person was very broke. Both of these men are in attendance, they seem to know each other. They both have little medals that they are pinning on this person; they are badges of great honor and strength. The badges sparkle in the sunlight, and everyone cheers.</p><p>This person suddenly feels the need to check her post office box. It is an old habit, and even if everything is going to be terrific from now on, this person still wants mail. This person says she will be right back and everyone this person has ever known says, Fine, take your time. This person gets in her car and drives to the post office and opens the box and there is nothing. Even though it is a Tuesday, which is famously a good day for mail. This person is so disappointed, this person gets back in the car and, having completely forgotten about the picnic, drives home and checks the voice mail and there are no new messages, just the old one about "passing the test" and "life being better." There are no e-mails, either, probably because everyone is at the picnic. This person can't seem to go back to the picnic. This person realizes that staying home means blowing off everyone this person has ever known. But the desire to stay in is very strong. This person wants to run a bath and then read in bed.</p><p>In the bathtub this person pushes the bubbles around and listens to the sound of millions of them popping at once. It almost makes one smooth sound instead of many tiny sounds. This person's breasts barely jut out of the water. This person pushes the bubbles onto the breasts and makes weird shapes with the foam. By now everyone must have realized that this person is not coming back to the picnic. Everyone was wrong; this person is not who they thought this person was. This person plunges underwater and moves her hair around like a sea anemone. This person can stay underwater for an impressively long time but only in a bathtub. This person wonders if there will ever be an Olympic contest for holding your breath under bathwater. If there were such a contest, this person would surely win it. An Olympic medal might redeem this person in the eyes of everyone this person has ever known. But no such contest exists, so there will be no redeeming. This person mourns the fact that she has ruined her one chance to be loved by everyone; as this person climbs into bed, the weight of this tragedy seems to bear down upon this person's chest. And it is a comforting weight, almost human in heft. This person sighs. This person's eyes begin to close, this person sleeps.</p><p>Copyright � 2007 by Miranda July</p></p><h2>Spirit of Shaolin: A Kung Fu Philosophy</h2><p>A well-known martial arts expert describes the philosophy behind Kung Fu, discussing the ancient wisdom of the Chinese masters, the principles of Shaolin thought, and the inner meaning of martial arts. Reprint.</p><p>At first glance, this book appears to be a historical and philosophical treatment of Shaolin Kung Fu. But the reader soon discovers that it is more the story of Carradine the actor/martial artist, plus a limited philosophy of Kung Fu. The first half of the book is interesting. It gives an account of Carradine's initiation into the martial arts and his work on the TV series Kung Fu . Carradine comes across as very self-assured and completely devoted to the arts. The second part focuses on the philosophy of Kung Fu, but the narrative is disjointed and rambling. Points are not always clear and some bits of "wisdom" sound as if they came out of a fortune cookie. Carradine fans and martial arts supporters will probably enjoy this book, but those looking for instruction will not find it here.<br><i>- Jennifer Langlois, Missouri Western State Coll.

In this new book by Gijs van Hensbergen, the acclaimed biographer of Gaud�, the author explores the life of this key cultural icon from its birth to the present day. He tells the story of the painting's beginnings, amid the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War; describes its use as a weapon in the propaganda battle against Fascism; tells how it traveled overseas to become the nucleus of the Museum of Modern Art's creation in New York; and finally writes movingly of its role as a symbol of reconciliation for Spain after the death of Franco, when it returned to that country as democracy was reestablished. </p><p>Guernica is a story of national struggle, political exile, and the power of art as a tool of protest and of healing. Ingeniously chronicling the last century using Picasso's visionary tableau, van Hensbergen offers a new way of understanding our own history.</p></p><p>Gijs van Hensbergen lectures on architecture and is the author of Art Deco (1986), A Taste of Castile (1992, reissued 2003) and the acclaimed biography Gaud� (2001).To this day, there is scarcely a protest march in which Picasso's "Guernica" does not appear, perpetually revived in times of raw brutality. Picasso's great assault on barbarism is, as the title of Gijs van Hensbergen's book describes it, a 20th-century icon. Van Hensbergen's account of its gestation and its final destiny in Madrid joins previous publications by Rudolph Arnheim, Herschel B. Chipp and Frank D. Russell, examining in minute detail both the circumstances of the painting's creation and the power of its imagery. Van Hensbergen, however, focuses less on its artistic merits and more on the role it has played in the world's psyche. <p>The event that galvanized Picasso was the three-hour incendiary bombardment of the small Basque town of Guernica on April 26, 1937, by Italian and German planes, an attack that turned the town into "a burning fireball." Days later, Picasso began work on his passionate riposte, as a defender of the legitimate Republican government. Like other European intellectuals, he recognized the ominous significance of Europeans using saturation bombing on defenseless European citizens -- the first declaration, as the Nazis proclaimed, that there are no innocent civilians in total war.</p><p>Picasso's prodigious painting was exhibited, along with works by Mir� and Gonzalez, among others, in the Spanish pavilion at the 1937 Expo in Paris. Van Hensbergen, who has also written a biography of the architect Antinio Gaudi, gives the most complete account to date of the elaborate and difficult preparations for the Expo made by the besieged Spanish government, and the varied responses to its dramatic visual offerings. He enlarges our perception of the cultural circumstances and admirably sums up Picasso's engagement: "Guernica was his homeland, his waste land, his burnt-out pile." </p><p>Once the Expo was over, "Guernica" began its astonishing tour throughout Europe, and to Brazil and the United States, to alert the world to the catastrophe and to raise funds for the victims of Franco's atrocities. When it arrived in New York, it became a matter of capital importance to American artists who had long recognized Picasso as a master. Local painters thronged to see it exhibited in a Manhattan gallery, where they also attended two symposia in the painting's presence. Van Hensbergen quotes the painter Dorothea Tanning describing hearing Arshile Gorky, one of New York's most charismatic painters: "We listened as a gaunt, intense, young man, with an enormous Nietzschean moustache . . . talked about the picture. . . . I believe he talked about intentions and fury and tenderness and the suffering of the Spanish people. He would point out a strategic line, and follow it into battle, as it clashed on the far side of the picture with a spiky chaos. He did not, during the entire evening, smile. It was as if he could not." </p><p>There is no doubt that the burgeoning New York movement called abstract expressionism was inspirited by this encounter with "Guernica." Van Hensbergen dwells too much on Jackson Pollock, suggesting he was Picasso's heir, and attempts with limited success to probe the painting's influence on New York painters. But more interesting is his account of the FBI's zealous surveillance (187 pages of it in Picasso's FBI file), beginning with J. Edgar Hoover's instructions to the U.S. embassy in Paris in 1945: "In the event information concerning Picasso comes to your attention, it should be furnished to the Bureau in view of the possibility that he may attempt to come to the United States." In fact, Picasso was never permitted to come here because of his communist ties.</p><p>Especially good on Franco's postwar Spain, van Hensbergen is well-informed on the artistic underground; on Franco's attempt to use young Spanish vanguard artists as pawns in his political maneuvers with Europe and the United States; and on horrifying events such as the sacking of an art gallery exhibiting Picasso's graphic work by the right-wing terrorist group Guerilleros del Cristo Rey in 1971 (only last year they tried to storm a cultural center in Madrid!). Finally, he details the elaborate and controversial moves toward repatriating "Guernica" after Franco's death, and its triumphal entry into Madrid on Sept. 10, 1981.</p><p>The fate of "Guernica" was yoked to the fate of Picasso's legacy. In his family memoir, the painter's grandson, Olivier Widmaier Picasso, offers an exhaustive account of each of the heirs' positions, actions and legal battles, and of their attitudes toward Spain immediately after Franco. For instance, Maya, Olivier's mother, suggested putting off the transfer until there was sure evidence that Spain had indeed become a republic, as Picasso had stipulated. The author has traced every legal meeting and the results, offering for the first time a total account of the settling of the Picasso estate, and, as a corollary, the final disposition of "Guernica."</p><p>The younger Picasso comes across as the genial grandson who takes it upon himself to save the great painter's honor by carefully refuting many of the slanderous attacks printed during the past 20 years. Like his grandfather, Widmaier Picasso detests gossip. As a trained lawyer, he knows the value of documenting, and has probed his grandfather's practical and amorous life with the keen eye of an evidence-gatherer.</p><p>His account will also be valuable to historians interested in Picasso's political positions. In careful, measured terms, he describes the artist's lifelong interest in oppositional, radical causes, and unlike most American commentators, he takes the trouble to describe the circumstances under which Picasso joined the French Communist Party. "You see," he quotes Picasso as saying, "I am not French but Spanish. I am against Franco. The only way I could make it known was by joining the Communist Party, thus proving I belonged to the other side." The cultural climate within which Picasso made his decision, after World War II, was far from being the monolithic entity so easily attacked by North American critics, and the author strives to set his grandfather's gesture within its properly complex circumstances. </p><p>Reviewed by Dore Ashton <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

It is widely regarded as Asimov&#39;s single best SF novel. Andrew Harlan is an Eternal, a member of the elite of the future. One of the few who live in Eternity, a location outside of place and time, Harlan&#39;s job is to create carefully controlled and enacted Reality Changes. These Changes are small, exactingly calculated shifts in the course of history, made for the benefit of humankind. Though each Change has been made for the greater good, there are also always costs. During one of his assignments, Harlan meets and falls in love with No�s Lambent, a woman who lives in real time and space. Then Harlan learns that No�s will cease to exist after the next Change, and he risks everything to sneak her into Eternity. Unfortunately, they are caught. Harlan&#39;s punishment? His next assignment: Kill the woman he loves before the paradox they have created results in the destruction of Eternity.</p><p>Isaac Asimov (1920-1992) was born in Russia and taken to America in 1923, becoming an American citizen in 1928. He took a degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1939, and took his MA in 1941 and his PhD in 1948, after spending the war years in the Naval Air Experimental Station. He joined the Boston University School of Medicine in 1949, becoming associate professor of biochemistry. He is best known for the Robot and Foundation sequences.<p>1. TECHNICIAN</p><p>Andrew Harlan stepped into the kettle. Its sides were perfectly round and it fit snugly inside a vertical shaft composed of widely spaced rods that shimmered into an unseeable haze six feet above Harlan&#x2019;s head. Harlan set the controls and moved the smoothly working starting lever.</p><p>The kettle did not move.</p><p>Harlan did not expect it to. He expected no movement; neither up nor down, left nor right, forth nor back. Yet the spaces between the rods had melted into a gray blankness which was solid to the touch, though nonetheless immaterial for all that. And there was the little stir in his stomach, the faint (psychosomatic?) touch of dizziness, that told him that all the kettle contained, including himself, was rushing upwhen through Eternity.</p><p>He had boarded the kettle in the 575th Century, the base of operations assigned him two years earlier. At the time the 575th had been the farthest upwhen he had ever traveled. Now he was moving upwhen to the 2456th Century.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances he might have felt a little lost at the prospect. His native Century was in the far downwhen, the 95th Century, to be exact. The 95th was a Century stiffly restrictive of atomic power, faintly rustic, fond of natural wood as a structural material, exporters of certain types of distilled potables to nearly everywhen and importers of clover seed. Although Harlan had not been in the 95th since he entered special training and became a Cub at the age of fifteen, there was always that feeling of loss when one moved outwhen from "home." At the 2456th he would be nearly two hundred forty millennia from his birth when and that is a sizable distance even for a hardened Eternal.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances all this would be so.</p><p>But right now Harlan was in poor mood to think of anything but the fact that his documents were heavy in his pocket and tense, a little confused.</p><p>It was his hands acting by themselves that brought the kettle to the proper halt at the proper Century.</p><p>Strange that a Technician should feel tense or nervous about anything. What was it that Educator Yarrow had once said:</p><p>"Above all, a Technician must be dispassionate. The Reality Change he initiates may affect the lives of as many as fifty billion people. A million or more of these may be so drastically affected as to be considered new individuals. Under these conditions, an emotional make-up is a distinct handicap."</p><p>Harlan put the memory of his teacher&#x2019;s dry voice out of his mind with an almost savage shake of his head. In those days he had never imagined that he himself would have the peculiar talent for that very position. But emotion had come upon him after all. Not for fifty billion people. What in Time did he care for fifty billion people? There was just one. One person.</p><p>He became aware that the kettle was stationary and with the merest pause to pull his thoughts together, put himself into the cold, impersonal frame of mind a Technician must have, he stepped out. The kettle he left, of course, was not the same as the one he had boarded, in the sense that it was not composed of the same atoms. He did not worry about that any more than any Eternal would. To concern oneself with the mystique of Time-travel, rather than with the simple fact of it, was the mark of the Cub and newcomer to Eternity.</p><p>He paused again at the infinitely thin curtain of non-Space and non-Time which separated him from Eternity in one way and from ordinary Time in another.</p><p>This would be a completely new section of Eternity for him. He knew about it in a rough way, of course, having checked upon it in the Temporal Handbook. Still, there was no substitute for actual appearance and he steeled himself for the initial shock of adjustment.</p><p>He adjusted the controls, a simple matter in passing into Eternity (and a very complicated one in passing into Time, a type of passage which was correspondingly less frequent). He stepped through the curtain and found himself squinting at the brilliance. Automatically he threw up his hand to shield his eyes.</p><p>Only one man faced him. At first Harlan could see him only blurrily.</p><p>The man said, "I am Sociologist Kantor Voy. I imagine you are Technician Harlan."</p><p>Harlan nodded and said, "Father Time! Isn&#x2019;t this sort of ornamentation adjustable?"</p><p>Voy looked about and said tolerantly, "You mean the molecular films?"</p><p>"I certainly do," said Harlan. The Handbook had mentioned them, but had said nothing of such an insane riot of light reflection.</p><p>Harlan felt his annoyance to be quite reasonable. The 2456th Century was matter-oriented, as most Centuries were, so he had a right to expect a basic compatibility from the very beginning. It would have none of the utter confusion (for anyone born matter-oriented) of the energy vortices of the 300&#x2019;s, or the field dynamics of the 600&#x2019;s. In the 2456th, to the average Eternal&#x2019;s comfort, matter was used for everything from walls to tacks.</p><p>To be sure, there was matter and matter. A member of an energy-oriented Century might not realize that. To him all matter might seem minor variations on the theme that was gross, heavy, and barbaric. To matter-oriented Harlan, however, there was wood, metal (subdivisions, heavy and light), plastic, silicates, concrete, leather, and so on.</p><p>But matter consisting entirely of mirrors!</p><p>That was his first impression of the 2456th. Every surface reflected and glinted light. Everywhere was the illusion of complete smoothness; the effect of a molecular film. And in the ever-repeated reflection of himself, of Sociologist Voy, of everything he could see, in scraps and wholes, in all angles, there was confusion. Garish confusion and nausea!</p><p>"I&#x2019;m sorry," said Voy, "it&#x2019;s the custom of the Century, and the Section assigned to it finds it good practice to adopt the customs where practical. You get used to it after a time."</p><p>Voy walked rapidly upon the moving feet of another Voy, upside down beneath the floor, who matched him stride for stride. He reached to move a hair-contact indicator down a spiral scale to point of origin.</p><p>The reflections died; extraneous light faded. Harlan felt his world settle.</p><p>"If you&#x2019;ll come with me now," said Voy.</p><p>Harlan followed through empty corridors that, Harlan knew, must moments ago have been a riot of made light and reflection, up a ramp, through an anteroom, into an office.</p><p>In all the short journey no human being had been visible. Harlan was so used to that, took it so for granted, that he would have been surprised, almost shocked, if a glimpse of a human figure hurrying away had caught his eyes. No doubt the news had spread that a Technician was coming through. Even Voy kept his distance and when, accidentally, Harlan&#x2019;s hand had brushed Voy&#x2019;s sleeve, Voy shrank away with a visible start.</p><p>Harlan was faintly surprised at the touch of bitterness he felt at this. He had thought the shell he had grown about his soul was thicker, more efficiently insensitive than that. If he was wrong, if his shell had worn thinner, there could only be one reason for that.</p><p>No�s!</p><p>Sociologist Kantor Voy leaned forward toward the Technician in what seemed a friendly enough fashion, but Harlan noted automatically that they were seated on opposite sides of the long axis of a fairly large table.</p><p>Voy said, "I am pleased to have a Technician of your reputation interest himself in our little problem here."</p><p>"Yes," said Harlan with the cold impersonality people would expect of him. "It has its points of interest." (Was he impersonal enough? Surely his real motives must be apparent, his guilt be spelled out in beads of sweat on his forehead.)</p><p>He removed from an inner pocket the foiled summary of the projected Reality Change. It was the very copy which had been sent to the Allwhen Council a month earlier. Through his relationship with Senior Computer Twissell (the Twissell, himself) Harlan had had little trouble in getting his hands on it.</p><p>Before unrolling the foil, letting it peel off onto the table top where it would be held by a soft paramagnetic field, Harlan paused a split moment.</p><p>The molecular film that covered the table was subdued but was not zero. The motion of his arm fixed his eye and for an instant the reflection of his own face seemed to stare somberly up at him from the tabletop. He was thirty-two, but he looked older. He needed no one to tell him that. It might be partly his long face and dark eyebrows over darker eyes that gave him the lowering expression and cold glare associated with the caricature of the Technician in the minds of all Eternals. It might be just his own realization that he was a Technician.</p><p>But then he flicked the foil out across the table and turned to the matter at hand.</p><p>"I am not a Sociologist, sir."</p><p>Voy smiled. "That sounds formidable. When one begins by expressing lack of competence in a given field, it usually implies that a flat opinion in that field will follow almost immediately."</p><p>"No," said Harlan, "not an opinion. Just a request. I wonder if you won&#x2019;t look over this summary and see if you haven&#x2019;t made a small mistake somewhere here."</p><p>Voy looked instantly grave. "I hope not," he said.</p><p>Harlan kept one arm across the back of his chair, the other in his lap. He must let neither hand drum restless fingers. He must not bite his lips. He must not show his feelings in any way.</p><p>Ever since the whole orientation of his life had so changed itself, he had been watching the summaries of projected Reality Changes as they passed through the grinding administrative gears of the Allwhen Council. As Senior Computer Twissell&#x2019;s personally assigned Technician, he could arrange that by a slight bending of professional ethics. Particularly with Twissell&#x2019;s attention caught ever more tightly in his own overwhelming project. (Harlan&#x2019;s nostrils flared. He knew now a little of the nature of that project.)</p><p>Harlan had had no assurance that he woul...</p></p><h2>Takane &amp; Hana, Vol. 3 (3)</h2><p>A strong-willed high school girl and a hot, young scion of a business empire can&#x2019;t help wanting to outwit each other every chance they get...

She lives with her husband, an economics professor, in Tokyo.<br>A characteristic Japanese family meal, Tokyo-born Urakami tells us, includes ``a main dish of fish or meat, a side dish of braised vegetables, and a vinegared salad, accompanied by steamed rice and soup.'' The 53 recipes here feature vegetables such as sauteed burdock and braised daikon, as well as familiar dishes like yakitori , but as this book is meant for English-speaking cooks everywhere, Americans may find curious the instruction to ``coat the pot well with beef suet'' in the recipe for sukiyaki . Likewise, for ``marinated spicy fresh-water smelt,'' readers will want to know the size of the smelts (not given), and may be nonplussed by its substitute, ``horse mackerel fillets, cut into slices.'' The recipe for breaded fried swordfish lists only ``breadcrumbs for coating fish'' instead of panko , the coarse Japanese breadcrumbs that give a typically crunchy surface. Information is rather lacking on Japanese ingredients; in the refreshing-sounding recipe for salad with tofu dressing, the author assumes our familiarity with ``deep-fried tofu pouches'' and `` konnyaku (devil's tongue)sic .'' It is necessary to read the front matter; a recipe for the broth called dashi , used in more than half the recipes, appears under ``Cooking Notes.''

The present 1992 edition was edited to reflect the modern use of inclusive language, and includes an introduction by Vedic scholar David Frawley. Mr. Frawley explains to the Western reader, "The Vedas are the original scripture or source teaching of the Hindu tradition, from which its many branches of Vedanta, Yoga, and Tantra have emerged through time, and to which they all look back with reverence." The Vedas are also "..the background relative to which the Buddhist religion evolved, and Buddhism also preserves many Vedic terms and practices."

Architects, engineers, builders, and developers have struggled in this environment for years. Architects are commoditized, and contractors struggle with the same risk they have carried for centuries; critical design information is withheld until the submittal process; no practical risk management instrument has been developed; and buildings are still created one brick at a time. Owners have played their part in this inefficiency. Some continue to believe in the value myth of competitive bidding, sentencing themselves to be eternally locked in inefficient processes. But it is owners who can impact the industry most deliberately and aggressively. It is owners who can drive innovation on their projects and create profound change in the industry. In fact, it is owners who are uniquely positioned to innovate. By planning the design and delivery process, becoming team leaders, collaborating deeply throughout the industry, and applying key elements documented in The Owner&#39;s Dilemma, owners can summon meaningful and lasting change. The Owner&#39;s Dilemma explores how best to use the power of the owner and how that power can recreate the building industry.</p><p>Barbara White Bryson is the associate vice president for facilities engineering and planning at Rice University. During her 10 years at Rice, she has overseen design and construction projects totaling more than $1 billion that have added more than 2 million gross square feet to the campus. Bryson is a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and a member of the Design Futures Council and the Association of University Architects. Canan Yetmen is principal of CYMK Group, an Austin, Texas, consulting firm that provides writing services to architecture and design firms around the country. From 1995 to 2001, she was publisher of Texas Architect magazine, where she directed marketing and business management of the magazine as well as the public outreach and communications efforts of the Texas Society of Architects.Every manager of facility acquisition as well as the architects, engineers, construction managers, and builders who work for these new leaders should read this insightful book. --Charles Thomsen<br><br>The Owner's Dilemma should be required reading for anyone involved in the A/E/C industry -- owners, architects, and construction managers alike. It offers a clear diagnosis about what's wrong with the industry and a compelling vision about how to move forward. --Scott Simpson<br><br>The Owner's Dilemma asks us to understand that two things are crucial. First, that each of its five elements is considered individually and given equal weight and second, that the five elements are considered collectively and this collective thinking must be maintained throughout the entire project. If the individual keys are managed well, the collective group will clearly be successful. --Michael Graves</p><h2>Dragonology: Pocket Adventures</h2><p><b>For true dragonologists! Four exciting pocket-size books packed with choose-your-own adventures</b><br><br>A rogue frost dragon is devastating Iceland and blasting everyone in its path. A savage serpent has been disturbed by treasure hunters diving in its lake home. What is a dragonologist to do? These irresistible adventures outline each mission, propose choices along the way, and detail the consequences (scrunched! frozen! drowned in a vat of gold!) should even the best-prepared readers misstep. Luckily, each mission may be repeated as many times as necessary, and a certificate of achievement awaits adventurers at the end. Tucked in an attractive slipcase, this quartet of titles &#x2014; THE ICELAND WYRM, THE DRAGON STAR, THE DRAGON DANCE, and THE WINGED SERPANT &#x2014; makes an ideal gift and will keep readers mesmerized for hours on end.</p><p>Dugald A. Steer, Editor: "With what trepidation I sat down to give my editorial attentions to what was clearly the masterwork of a very erudite man, should be obvious to all who read this book." So begins a letter, written in 1894, from Dugald Steer to an Oxford friend. The letter goes on to explain how a chance meeting with Dr. Ernest Drake at the BULL'S HEAD TAVERN in Dorking, Surrey, made him more than a little curious. Skeptical at first, he took up Dr. Drake's offer to meet him at his house and St. Leonard's Forest, and to attend one of the S.A.S.D. meetings in London. There, he became further involved in Dr. Drake's work, joining him on an expedition to Scotland to try and estimate the hunting range of the Dornoch Wyrm. As he writes, the trip was, "a cause of some emotion, as many of my relative, particularly the Ross branch, come from so near."<br><br>Douglas Carrel, Chief Draughtsman: A native of Scotland, Douglas Carrel was clearly a dragonologist of some standing, and often accompanied Dr. Drake on some of his more fruitful expeditions. In a letter from Constantinople to the editor he says, "It is with considerable sense of honour, and no small amount of pride, that I lend my hand to the compiling of this most worthy volume . . . Ultimately, I feel that all of us&#x2014;within this privileged circle in particular&#x2014;are duty-bound to preserve and perpetuate the love and lore of dragons."<br><br>Helen Ward, Scientific Artist: Helen Ward trained as an illustrator at Brighton School of Art, although it is not known exactly when she came into contact with Dr. Drake. However a quote from her autobiography makes some things clear: "As a child I dreamed of dragons. When age allowed, I traveled. Unfortunately, several expeditions to Europe and one to that part of Russia known as Finland specifically to capture the likeness of a live dragon have ended in failure. The creatures seemed deliberately elusive . . .. With the help of descriptions, notes, and detailed drawings made by others I have managed to illustrate these majestic creatures to the satisfaction of those more fortunate and better-informed dragonologists." <br><br>Wayne Anderson, Pictorial Artist: Interested in cryptozoology from an early age, Wayne Anderson first came into contact with S.A.S.D. at one of their meetings in Wyvern Way in London. It was after a couple of trips with Drake&#x2014;to the Alps in 1878 and to Scotland in 1880&#x2014;that Wayne realized his early dragon drawings were, in fact, more life-like than he could have realised. Like most of the other collaborators on DRAGONOLOGY, he has contributed to many other books for children. He enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with Helen Ward that resulted in books such as THE TIN FOREST and THE DRAGON MACHIINE.<br><br>Nghiem Ta, Artistic Direction: Dr. Drake met Nghiem Ta in the Fukien (now Fujian) Province of China where she was working in her grandfather's bookshop. Their shared interest in dragons became evident when he showed her a copy of the fabled DRAGON SUTRA of Hong Wei, which the monks of that monastery made for him as a gift. He asked Miss Ta if such a revered object could be bound into a book and was so impressed with her work that he later invited her to London to oversee the creation of DRAGONOLOGY.</p><h2>God&#39;s Supernatural Power</h2><p><p>Heaven and hell pose the same question to each of us.

This is a very ambitious aim, so the end result is rather mixed: the section on the history of the Gullahs as they left West Africa and endured slavery times in America and afterwards is interesting and well organized. The section on religious practices is also informative. However, the information on the native Gullah dialect gets rather complicated for the intended audience. In other parts of the book, Branch drifts constantly between the objective presentation of material and her personal experiences. This leads to a rather scattered, piecemeal book. It is illustrated with black-and-white photographs. Overall, this title would be of interest to libraries with extensive collections on African American life and to regional collections.?Kay McPherson, Central Atlanta-Fulton Public Library, GA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 5^-9. The Gullah people who live on the Sea Islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia are descendants of slaves who stayed after the emancipation. This account of their history, Creole language, folklore, and culture draws on scholarly sources and also on Branch's personal observations, interviews, and experiences on the islands. The narrative is dry, and the various parts aren't always smoothly integrated, but many readers will find the place and people of compelling interest, especially since Branch shows that the unique traditional culture, closely connected to West Africa and the West Indies, is now threatened by tourism and land development. There's a detailed bibliography of books and articles for those who want to read further. Throughout, black-and-white prints and photos focus on individual people and historical landmarks that tell a remarkable story. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>The Essential Chogyam Trungpa</h2><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa wrote more than two dozen books on Buddhism and the Shambhala path of warriorship. <i>The Essential Ch�gyam Trungpa </i> blends excerpts from bestsellers like <i>Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, Meditation in Action, </i> and other titles into a concise overview of Trungpa's teachings.

Upon an Error in the Second Century B. C.</h2><p><p><strong>Gerrard Dickson proposes here a series of alternative theories of astronomy, the place of the Earth and Sun in the universe, and the mathematics of the cosmos.</strong></p><p> </p><p>After a revelatory experience, Gerrard Dickson began to dispute the distances involved between the Earth and the Sun. This book broadens and expands its scope, questioning the validity of underlying assumptions in astronomical science. Using the work of the ancient Greek and Roman scientists as a starting point, Dickson takes us forward through millennia of developments, asserting throughout that the basis of established science is unsound and thus in need of substantial overhaul.</p><p> </p><p>The later chapters of this book are occupied with refuting the theories propagated by the physicist Albert Einstein. Conceding that the notion of relativity is clever, Dickson nevertheless posits that it is based on unsound assumptions and is thus invalid. For the author, relativity is - alongside Newtonian physics and earlier theories of antiquity - a further step toward the wrongness that defines conventional astronomy.</p><p> </p><p>Although his ideas gained some notice for their novelty, the alternative hypotheses of astronomy posited by Dickson have been discredited. Successful use of conventional astronomic calculations in fields such as avionics, rocketry, space exploration, and communication satellites have affirmed that established mathematics and distances agreed on by science are sound. However, Dickson's theories remain a curiosity - it is to sate this that this book is reprinted, complete with the author's own illustrated diagrams.</p></p><p></p><h2>Jingle Bells: A Magical Pop-up Edition</h2><p>A beautifully illustrated cut-paper mini edition of the classic Christmas song, with a spectacular pop-up finale.

A New York Times bestselling author and voted one of the top ten romance writers in America, she has a gift for telling the most sensual tales with charm and humor. Diana lives with her family in Cornelia, Georgia.<br><br>There was a cardinal rule that people who gave parties never invited both Barrie Bell and her stepbrother, Dawson Rutherford, to the same social event. Since the two of them didn't have a lot of mutual friends, and they lived in different states, it wasn't often broken. But every rule had an exception, and tonight, Barrie discovered, was it.<br><br>She hadn't really wanted to go out, but Martha and John Mercer, old friends of the Rutherfords who'd taken a interest in Barrie since their move to Tucson, insisted that she needed a diversion. She wasn't teaching this summer, after all, and the part-time job that kept her bank account healthy had just ended abruptly. Barrie needed cheering up and Martha was giving a party that was guaranteed to accomplish it.<br><br>Actually it had. Barrie felt brighter than she had in some months. She was sequestered on the steps of the staircase in the hall with two admirers, one who was a bank executive and the other who played guitar with a jazz band. She was wearing a dress guaranteed to raise blood pressures, silver and clinging from its diamante straps at her lightly tanned shoulders to her ankles, with a long, seductive slit up one side of the skirt. The color of her high heels matched the dress. She wore her long, wavy black hair loose, so that it reached almost to her waist. In her creamy-complexioned, oval face, bright green eyes shone with a happy glitter.<br><br>That was, they <em>had</em> been shining until she saw Dawson Rutherford come in the front door. Her sophisticated chatter had died abruptly and she withdrew into a shell, looking vulnerable and hunted.<br><br>Her two companions didn't connect her stepbrother's entrance with Barrie's sudden change. Not, at least, until a few minutes later when he spotted her in the hall and, excusing himself to his hostess, came to find her with a drink in his hand.<br><br>Dawson was more than a match for any man present, physically. Some of them were spectacularly handsome, but Dawson was more so. He had wavy blond hair, cut conventionally short, a deep tan, chiseled, perfect facial features and deep-set pale green eyes at least two shades lighter than Barrie's. He was tall and slender, but there were powerful muscles in that lithe body, which was kept fit from hours in the saddle. Dawson was a multimillionaire, yet being the boss didn't keep him from helping out on the many ranches he owned. It was nothing unusual to find him cutting out calves for branding on the Wyoming ranches, or helping to drive cattle across the spinifex plains of the several-thousand-square-mile station in Australia's Channel Country. He spent his leisure hours, which were very few, working with his Thoroughbred horses on the headquarters ranch in Sheridan, Wyoming, when he wasn't buying and selling cattle all over the country.<br><br>He was an elegant man, from his hand-tooled leather boots to the expensive slacks and white silk turtleneck shirt he wore with a designer jacket. Everything about him, from his Rolex to the diamond horseshoe ring on his right hand, screamed wealth. And with the elegant good looks, there was a cold, calculating intelligence. Dawson spoke French and Spanish fluently, and he had a degree in business.<br><br>Barrie's two companions seemed to shrink when he appeared beside them, a drink cradled in one big, lean hand. He didn't drink often, and never to excess. He was the sort of man who never liked to lose control in any way. She'd seen him lose it just once. Perhaps that was why he hated her so, because she was the only one who ever had.<br><br>"Well, well, what was Martha thinking, I wonder, that rules were made to be broken?" Dawson asked her, his deep voice like velvet even though it carried above the noise.<br><br>"Martha invited me. She didn't invite you," Barrie said coldly. "I'm sure it was John. He's laughing," she added, her gaze going to Martha's husband across the room.<br><br>Dawson followed her glance to his host and raised his glass. The shorter man raised his in acknowledgment and, catching Barrie's furious glare, turned quickly away.<br><br>"Aren't you going to introduce me?" Dawson continued, unabashed, his eyes going now to the two men beside her.<br><br>"Oh, this is Ted and that's.. what was your name?" she somewhat abruptly asked the second man.<br><br>"Bill," he replied.<br><br>"This is my...stepbrother, Dawson Rutherford," she continued.<br><br>Bill grinned and extended his hand. It was ignored, although Dawson nodded curtly in acknowledgment. The younger man cleared his throat and smiled sheepishly at Barrie, brandishing his glass. "Uh, I need a refill," he said quickly, because Dawson's eyes were narrowing and there was a distinct glitter in them.<br><br>"Me, too," Ted added and, grinning apologetically at Barrie, took off.<br><br>Barrie glared after them. "Craven cowards," she muttered.<br><br></p><h2>Talking It Over</h2><p>In this powerfully affecting Flaubert&#39;s Parrot gives readers a brilliant take on the deceptions that make up the quivering substrata of erotic love. &#34;An interplay of serious thought and dazzling wit. . . . It&#39;s moving, it&#39;s funny, it&#39;s frightening . . . fiction at its best.&#34;--New York Times Book Review.</p><p>Born in Leicester in 1946, Julian Barnes is the author of nine novels, a book of stories, and a collection of essays. He has won both the Prix M�dicis and the Prix F�mina, and in 1988 was made a Chevalier de l&#39;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He lives in London.This tour de force of alternating monologues tells the story of Stuart, who marries Gillian; of his clever and nasty best friend, Oliver, who can't believe Stuart should be so lucky and quickly decides that, actually, he must have Gillian himself; and of course, of Gillian, who is in the middle. Each of these characters talks in turn to an unknown listener: explaining, excusing, blaming, protesting, rejoicing, regretting. It's an essentially theatrical, rather than narrative, exercise. And wonderfully, instead of having it read to us, Chivers has cast three impeccable actors, Steven Pacey, Alex Jennings, and Clare Higgins to play with and against each other, and there isn't a false note anywhere. A wonderful performance.

The renowned historian Anthony J. Badger cuts through decades of politicized history to provide a succinct, balanced, and timely reminder that Roosevelt&#x2019;s accomplishment was above all else an exercise in exceptional political craftsmanship.&nbsp;Declaring that Americans had &#x201c;nothing to fear but fear itself,&#x201d; Roosevelt entered the White House in 1933 confronting 25 percent unemployment, bank closings, and a nationwide crisis in confidence.From March 9 to June 16, FDR sent Congress a record number of bills, all of which passed easily. From legalizing the sale of beer to providing mortgage relief to millions of Americans, Roosevelt launched the New Deal that conservatives have been working to roll back ever since. Badger emphasizes Roosevelt&#x2019;s political gifts even as the president and his brain trust of advisers, guided by principles, largely felt their way toward solutions to the nation&#x2019;s manifold problems. Reintroducing the contingency that marked those fateful days, Badger humanizes Roosevelt and suggests a far more useful yardstick for future presidents: the politics of the possible under the guidance of principle.</p><p>Anthony J. Badger is Paul Mellon Professor of American History at Cambridge University and Master of Clare College. He is the author of a number of books, including <i>North Carolina and the New Deal </i>and <i>The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933&#x2013;1940</i>.Roosevelt took office in the throes of a horrible economic crisis for the U.S. The controversial New Deal was his emergency response to the Depression. Upon his inauguration, like President Obama, FDR appealed to a Democratic Congress and went to work spending money to create jobs. Narrator William Hughes handles the rapid-fire political and economic details without theatrical characters or emotion. With a quick pause in the narration, he makes it clear when he speaks the words of someone not the author. Hughes enhances the sometimes-tedious rhetoric by varying his pitch and rhythm, making the delivery conversational. Hearing this audiobook in the light of the new Obama administration, facing similar challenges, makes it more timely and appealing than it might otherwise be.

Waffles can seem, quite appealingly, the stuff of childhood kitchens and adult narcoleptic Sundays. But Greenspan, a food journalist, tries to move waffles into the culinary mainstream, where they can serve a purpose at almost any meal, and in between. She discusses proper equipment, appropriate pantry purchases, unusual dietary considerations and how waffles can accommodate them, and what to do with waffles made ahead of time--freeze and microwave, mainly. Then the waffles themselves, in many incarnations: whole-grain sourdough, rocky road, mustard, zucchini-cheddar, rhubarb, chocolate-amaretti. There is a tiramisu waffle, a lemon meringue waffle and a white chocolate-chip variant--all lavish, as expected. And Greenspan doesn't neglect the childish sweet-tooth: one chapter is entitled ``Just for Kids.'' So while it still seems unlikely, at the end of all, that anyone will actually grill up waffles for every meal, that possibility, as Greenspan presents it, is a pungent fantasy.</p></p><p></p><h2>Fear And Miss Betony (Rue Morgue Vintage Mysteries)</h2><p>Emma Betony was living out her dignified, elderly, poverty-stricken life when an appeal for help from a former student brought her to the little town of Martinmas and a nursing home transformed into a girls&#39; school.

This book examines eighteen of the desperate rearguard actions that occurred during the twelve days of this near rout.

With the possible exception of African-Americans and Harlem, no ethnic group has been so thoroughly understood and imagined through a particular chunk of space. Despite the fact that most American Jews have never set foot there--and many come from families that did not immigrate through New York much less reside on Hester or Delancey Street--the Lower East Side is firm in their collective memory. Whether they have been there or not, people reminisce about the Lower East Side as the place where life pulsated, bread tasted better, relationships were richer, tradition thrived, and passions flared.</p><br><p> This was not always so. During the years now fondly recalled (1880-1930), the neighborhood was only occasionally called the Lower East Side. Though largely populated by Jews from Eastern Europe, it was not ethnically or even religiously homogenous. The tenements, grinding poverty, sweatshops, and packs of roaming children were considered the stuff of social work, not nostalgia and romance. To learn when and why this dark warren of pushcart-lined streets became an icon, Hasia Diner follows a wide trail of high and popular culture. She examines children's stories, novels, movies, museum exhibits, television shows, summer-camp reenactments, walking tours, consumer catalogues, and photos hung on deli walls far from Manhattan.</p><br><p> Diner finds that it was after World War II when the Lower East Side was enshrined as the place through which Jews passed from European oppression to the promised land of America. The space became sacred at a time when Jews were simultaneously absorbing the enormity of the Holocaust and finding acceptance and opportunity in an increasingly liberal United States. Particularly after 1960, the Lower East Side gave often secularized and suburban Jews a biblical, yet distinctly American story about who they were and how they got here.</p><br><p> Displaying the author's own fondness for the Lower East Side of story books, combined with a commitment to historical truth, Lower East Side Memories is an insightful account of one of our most famous neighborhoods and its power to shape identity.</p></p><p><p>"Hasia Diner has written a richly researched and deeply informed account of the distinctive role New York's Lower East Side holds in American Jewish memory. She knows what the Lower East Side was; her book goes further and tells us what it has become in memory and nostalgia."--<b>Nathan Glazer, Harvard University</b></p><p>"<i>Lower East Side Memories</i> is a powerfully explicated, imaginatively researched, sensitively elaborated, and spiritedly written work of historical scholarship. Few subjects have been so fortunate as to inspire the passion, dedication, imagination, excitement, and scholarly acumen and range that give this book such vibrancy and power."--<b>Moses Rischin, author of <i>The Promised City</i></b></p><p>"In this pathbreaking book, Hasia Diner significantly advances the field of American Jewish history.

Reissue.</p><p>In the Well-Built City, Cley is the perfect judge and jury, the infallible arbiter of life and death, for he is trained in the art/science of physiognomy. To the physiognomist, body shape and facial features reveal every aspect of personality, expose every secret, and even predict the future. When Drachton Below, Master of the Well-Built City, sends his premier physiognomist into the primitive outlands to uncover the thief of an unperishing fruit that may grant immortality, Cley discovers love and the truth about physiognomy.

Like R. D. Laing, Maslow questioned the old psychoanalytic notions of being well or ill &#34;adjusted&#34; to the world and spoke from a broadly human base. Human nature---the inner nature of every individual which is uniquely his or her own---&#34;seems not to be . . . necessarily evil; . . . the basic human capacities are on their face either neutral, pre-moral or positively good.&#34; What we call evil behavior appears most often to be a secondary reaction to frustration of this intrinsic nature.&#34; On this foundation, Maslow built an affirmation of people and people&#39;s potentialities for self-fulfillment and psychological health. He considered his &#34;humanistic&#34; or &#34;Eupsychian&#34; approach to be part of the revolution then taking place in psychology, as in other fields, toward a new view of people. He saw people as sociable, creative, and loving beings whose welfare is not in the cure of &#34;neurosis&#34; or other ills, but on the development of their most socially and personally constructive potentials.</p><p></p><h2>The Church in China: How it Survives and Prospers Under Communism</h2><p>In spite of a repressive regime and the Cultural Revolution, China&#39;s body of believers is perhaps the largest in the world today!

Ava and Luc's sparks are immediate, and the evolution of their relationship-which starts with little common ground except a dedication to singlehood-is stimulating and realistic. They negotiate their professional and romantic interactions with banter that's clever but not self-satisfied, and their moment of truth feels warm and real. Fans of slightly gritty contemporaries will adore this"&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly </em>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"4 1/2 stars! The first in Layne's New York's Finest series is funny, delightfully steamy and deeply touching, setting the bar quite high. Layne creates protagonists who are fully realized and likable, ensuring that their individual journeys are as clever and moving as their romance, and her novels are always the better for it. A bustling, detailed setting and a stellar cast of supporting characters, particularly the hero's large and outspoken family, provide the perfect backdrop for her characters and keep expectations high for the rest of this soon-to-be-a-hit series."&#x2015;<b><i><em>RT Book Reviews</em></i></b><br><br>"Layne is hands down the queen of witty dialogue and sexy scenes.

Yet upon investigation, none of the employees can be linked to the gunman. And the grandfather-a life-long campaigner for social justice-is above reproach.

Soon it is chillingly clear: no corner of the city is safe, and her involvement will go deeper than she could ever have imagined.</p><p>Denise Mina is the author of <em>The End of the Wasp Season</em>, <em>Still Midnight</em>, <em>Slip of the Knife</em>, <em>The Dead Hour</em>, <em>Field of Blood</em>, <em>Deception</em>, and the Garnethill trilogy, the first installment of which won her the John Creasey Memorial Prize for best first crime novel. She lives in Glasgow.A post-office robbery in Glasgow turns deadly at the start of Mina&#x2019;s latest sharp thriller starring Strathclyde Detective Sergeant Alex Morrow. In the midst of the heist, elderly Brendan Lyons hands off his grandson to an unsuspecting stranger, then assists the AK-47-toting thief in filling bag after bag with cash. Lyons&#x2019; attempt to keep the peace backfires; the gunman shoots him in the back as he carries the score to the door. Was Lyons, a well-known local activist, in on the crime from the get-go? Meanwhile, more trouble is brewing around town. Charismatic politician Kenny Gallagher faces allegations of an affair with a very young woman, and two of Morrow&#x2019;s colleagues steal money from a drug deal but then, in a crisis of conscience, come clean about the deed. Award-winning Scottish crime writer Mina (The End of the Wasp Season, 2011) once again demonstrates her command of the police procedural, creating a compelling cast of characters, from the likable to the loathsome, and deftly linking the plots in a chilling ending. --Allison Block</p><h2>Lockheed Blackbird: Beyond the Secret Missions</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p>&#34;Author Crickmore has been involved in SR-71 operations to some extent and so is able to bring his own love of the aircraft to the reader...

At various times in the past, Shermer has believed in fundamentalist Christianity, alien abductions, Ayn Rand, megavitamin therapy, and deep-tissue massage. Now he believes in skepticism, and his motto is "<i>Cognite tute</i>--think for yourself." This updated edition of <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> covers Holocaust denial and creationism in considerable detail, and has chapters on abductions, Satanism, Afrocentrism, near-death experiences, Randian positivism, and psychics. Shermer has five basic answers to the implied question in his title: for consolation, for immediate gratification, for simplicity, for moral meaning, and because hope springs eternal. He shows the kinds of errors in thinking that lead people to believe weird (that is, unsubstantiated) things, especially the built-in human need to see patterns, even where there is no pattern to be seen. Throughout, Shermer emphasizes that skepticism (in his sense) does not need to be cynicism: "Rationality tied to moral decency is the most powerful joint instrument for good that our planet has ever known." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i><p><b>Michael Shermer</b> is the author of <i>The Believing Brain</i>, <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i>, <i>The Science of Good and Evil</i>, <i>The Mind Of The Market</i>, <i>Why Darwin Matters</i>, <i>Science Friction</i>, <i>How We Believe</i> and other books on the evolution of human beliefs and behavior.

The group included Hall of Famers Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Pee Wee Reese, and Jackie Robinson, the game&#39;s first black player. For the first time, Carl Erskine, another member of that legendary team, relates memories about his Dodger days. The result is a delightfully interesting trip through the world of 1950s baseball. Among Erskine&#39;s tales are his dealings with the immortal Branch Rickey, his view from the Dodger bench of Don Larsen&#39;s perfect game, and his firsthand experiences when Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.</p><p>Carl Erskine played twelve seasons with the Dodgers. Following his retirement in 1960, he returned to Anderson College in Indiana to coach baseball for twelve seasons, during which time his teams won four Hoosier College Conference championships and earned an appearance in the NAIA College World Series. He continues to be a community leader, participating in numerous organizations and businesses. <p>Burton Rocks is the coauthor, with former New York Yankee Paul O'Neill, of the New York Times bestseller Me and My Dad.</p>Brooklyn's beloved Oisk recalls life in Ebbetts Field and after.Erskine was a pitcher for the legendary Brooklyn Dodgers teams of the '40s and '50s, a 12-year major-league veteran who logged 122 victories, including a pair of no-hitters. As one of the famed Boys of Summer, he appeared in six World Series, most of them against the hated rivals from the Bronx, the New York Yankees. Off the field, Erskine is a soft-spoken Hoosier native, an affable, even sweet man, and it is those qualities that shine through this pleasant, if inconsequential book of anecdotes. At the outset of the book, Erskine writes, I can tell these stories because I was there, and he was, indeed, present for many of them, but too many of the items recounted herein are stories that have been told before elsewhere, often by better tale-bearers than the likable banker from Anderson, Indiana. However, there are a few real gems in this volume, ranging from Preacher Roe's decision to retire to a recipe for the buttermilk cake that became a lucky talisman for the '55 world champions from Brooklyn. There are, appropriately, a raft of stories about Branch Rickey, focusing on the Dodger general manager's legendary combination of penny-pinching, piety, and perspicuity. Erskine recounts the tale of Rickey's signing Jackie Robinson to become the first black major leaguer, but this is a story that has been told many, many times before. He also recounts some very funny anecdotes about contract negotiations with the tightfisted Rickey (including one in which he actually managed to get the better of the Dodger g.m., albeit with a little assist from the Commissioner's office). Erskine is a charming reminder of a simpler sports age, seemingly more innocent than today's mega-dollar, television-driven industrial era, but he is also smart enough to recognize and intimate that his own times were not quite as noble as they are painted by nostalgia buffs. Unfortunately, the book suffers from a total and complete lack of organization, with stories presented in no apparent order. Real fans, however, won't mind.A painlessly amusing walk around the old Dodger haunts in a Brooklyn that is no more. -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>The Parson (Peter Owen Modern Classic)</h2><p><i>The Parson</i> was not published in Anna Kavan&#x2019;s lifetime, but found after her death in manuscript form. Thought to have been written between the mid 50s and early 60s, it presages, through its undertones and imagery, some of Kavan&#x2019;s last and most enduring fiction (such as <i>Ice</i>). It was published finally, to wide acclaim, by Peter Owen in 1995. <i>The Parson</i> of the title is not a cleric, but an upright young army officer so nick-named for his apparent prudishness. On leave in his native homeland, he meets a rich and beguiling beauty, the woman of his dreams. The days that the Parson spends with Rejane, riding in and exploring the wild moorland have their own enchantment. But Rejane grows restless in this desolate land; doubtless in love with the Parson, she discourages any intimacy. Until that is, she persuades him to take her to a sinister castle situated on a treacherous headland. This&nbsp;is less a tale of unrequited love than exploration of divided selves, momentarily locked in an unequal embrace. Passion is revealed as a play of the senses as well as a destructive force. There have been valid comparisons to Poe, Kafka, and Thomas Hardy, but the presence of her trademark themes, cleverly juxtaposed and set in her risk-taking prose, mark <i>The Parson</i> as 100% Kavan.</p><p><p><strong>Anna Kavan was one of the greatest unsung enigmas in 20th-century British literature. Born as&nbsp;Helen Ferguson, who lived a fraught childhood and two failed marriages led her to change her name to that of one of her characters. Despite struggling with mental illness and heroin addiction for most of her life, she was still able to write fiction that was as powerful and memorable as any English female writer of the last 150 years.</strong></p>A painter, heroin addict and author of more than 15 books, Kavan (1901-1968) has developed a following in this country through books like A Charmed Circle and Mercury. The Parson, a posthumous discovery and the last of her novels to be published, is a compelling blend of heady description, dime-store plot and Poe-like devotion to the characterization of inner demons. Kavan's narrative consists almost exclusively of the interior monologues of Oswald, a soldier so upstanding he is nicknamed the Parson, and Rejane, a ferocious beauty for whom only nature is a fair match. The brief novel encompasses their meeting, their month-long acquaintance amid ghostly moors and their parting-with emphasis on all base, disturbing desires and conflict. Kavan fans will revel in the lyrical risk-taking of her prose, the emergence of some of her hallmark images and themes and her brilliant juxtapositions of ancient and modern, rich and poor, good and evil. This edition features three facsimile pages from an original draft with revisions; but, while it admits to "minor editorial emendations," it provides no footnotes for the changes. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Classic Elite Knits: 100 Gorgeous Designs for Every Occasion</h2><p>For over 25 years, knitters have relied on premium-quality yarns and patterns from Classic Elite, one of the country's most respected leaders in the knitting industry.

With marked tenderness, the contributors to <i>Reading Sedgwick</i> reflect on Sedgwick's many critical inventions, from her elucidation of poetry's close relation to criticism and development of new versions of queer performativity to highlighting the power of writing to engender new forms of life. As the essays in <i>Reading Sedgwick</i> demonstrate, Sedgwick's work is not only an ongoing vital force in queer theory and affect theory; it can help us build a more positive world in the midst of the bleak contemporary moment.<br><br> Contributors.

She lives in Toronto, Ontario.<br></p><p><b>Chapter Two<br>Special Delivery</b><br><br>That evening as I got ready for my first social outing in England, I wondered what a high table dinner was a table on stilts? I wore my only dress, a tie-dyed orange, red and turquoise mini with a halter top that tied at the back of my neck. It wasn&#x2019;t right for January at Oxford (or actually anytime at Oxford) but how was I supposed to know how cold it was <i>inside</i>? I figured it was no big deal to wear a dress that left me overexposed since I had to wear the black gown on top anyway. I also wore red patent-leather shoes with red, white and blue-checkered laces. They looked like old fashioned tap shoes from <i>42nd Street</i> except they had enormous platform heels.<br><br>Teetering in my heels, I clomped down the narrow winding stairs in my mini-dress and much-too-large robe that dragged on the ground like a wedding train in mourning. Because the stairwell was more like an educational silo than a normal staircase, the sound of my slapping shoes was magnified by the echo.<br><br>I walked down the stairs and doors swung open as I passed them. The first guy to pop his head out was Marcus Aaronson. He was short, slight and had brown curly hair that fell in unruly corkscrews on either side of his centre part. He wore a maroon sweater and a Trinity tie. He scowled, saying, Oh I thought I heard a blacksmith&#x2019;s hammer,&#x201d; and then abruptly closed his door.<br><br>As I wound down to another floor, a guy confidently strolled out of his rooms into the narrow staircase. He looked quite dapper, in a calculatedly casual sort of way, in a crumpled wool sports jacket and Oxford cloth white shirt, baggy black khakis, and black leather boots. I later learned this was the consciously dishevelled look that so many English graduate students affect while still technically following the dress code called <i>subfusc</i>. (<i>Subfusc</i> is Latin for dark/dusky colour. I had to go out and buy all black skirts and black tights. With my yellow hair I looked like a pencil in mourning.) He was slightly built but tall and had fashionably shaggy blond wavy hair, royal blue eyes and an aquiline nose. He looked a bit like Virginia Woolf on steroids, but then again so did many of the men I&#x2019;d seen from my window. He screamed landed-gentry-with-edge. I was sure that he was the man called Clive Hunter-Parsons who Reggie said was so universally admired.<br><br> Hark,&#x201d; he said, cupping his hand to his mouth and addressing the man who lived on the floor, time&#x2019;s horses gallop down the lessening hill.&#x201d; I was indeed clomping along, and as the shoes flipped off my narrow heel when I walked, they made a second echoing bang.<br>The guy from one flight down yelled up to where we stood, I feared it was a herd of wild Trojan horses, but fortunately we are not at war.&#x201d;<br><br> Ah,&#x201d; the blond boy added, we can rest at ease. It is only the descent of the fair sex, so to speak.&#x201d; I grabbed the railing as the spiral turned and I teetered against the wall, silencing my astonishingly loud foot clatter. I did manage to remember a line from Milton and, leaning against the wall to steady myself, said, No war or battle&#x2019;s sound, / was heard the world around.&#x201d;<br><br>The blond gave me the next line: Nothing but a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won.&#x201d;<br><br>Well, I was out of Ohio now. That was for sure.<br><br>I finally made it to the first floor and out crawled the only double X chromosome I&#x2019;d yet to see, presumably the New Englander, Margaret-Ann Mitchell. She wore one of those Laura Ashley sackcloth dresses, drawn in by a thick black hand knit sweater and flat boots that look like they were made by some local New England hippie turned leather worker. Her long, straight strawberry-blond<br><br>hair parted in the middle and drooped around her freckled face. Her black gown was also dragging on the ground. She made eye contact with me in the stairwell and blushed to the point that her face matched her hair. Excuse me,&#x201d; she mumbled and ran off toward the dining room, avoiding any further eye contact.<br><br>While I stood leaning against the curved wall of the staircase, trying to get my bearings and to remember where the dining hall was located, the blond guy passed me, accompanied by a dark-haired guy who had also exited his rooms in search of the heifer who was plodding down his stairwell. The blond, whose waves danced when he moved, carefully pushed open the door for me and said, Welcome to stairwell number seven. I am Clive Hunter-Parsons and this less-esteemed colleague is Peter Andover.&#x201d;<br><br> I am Helen of Troy,&#x201d; I said, teetering on my shiny red toes.<br><br> Then you won&#x2019;t mind our Spartan conditions,&#x201d; said Peter, the plainer guy who lived below the handsome guy named Clive. Peter could have been considered handsome as well if he had not been standing next to the imposingly tall, willowy Clive. While Clive looked relaxed and perpetually amused, Peter looked earnest, like the men who have their pictures in <i>The Economist</i>.<br><br> Reggie led me to believe we might eat together as a stairwell,&#x201d; I said lamely, hoping they would invite me.<br><br> Not tonight, Helen. We understand you are placed at the high table,&#x201d; Peter said.<br><br> Launching a thousand forks,&#x201d; I added.<br><br>Clive, Peter and I walked into the magnificent hall dining room with coffered ceilings and walls covered with dour portraits of famous alumni. I always sat under Sir John Willes, Chief Justice of Common Pleas, 1737. All the long, dark tables were lined up in solemn rows with benches. The room actually resembled the one on TV that Robin Hood used to swing through when he&#x2019;d surprised the Sheriff of Nottingham at mealtime. One huge table at the far end of the room was perpendicular to the rest and was placed on a separate dais a few steps up from the others. You didn&#x2019;t have to be Queen Elizabeth to figure it was the high table. It was filled with white-haired men, some of whom looked older than any professor I&#x2019;d ever seen, including all those who had crawled up to emeritus status.<br><br>Clive tapped my shoulder, saying, You don&#x2019;t wear gowns at high table.&#x201d;<br><br>Uh-oh. I&#x2019;d counted on this robe to cover my halter-top mini. Remembering the Mary Kay Cosmetic School saying, Fake it till you make it,&#x201d; I threw the black gown on the chair by the door, strode up to the high table and asked, Is one of you Professor Beech?&#x201d;<br><br> I beg your pardon?&#x201d; one old codger said.<br><br>Another smiled and said, May I offer you a seat.&#x201d; This guy was at least ninety and could have been a portrait on the wall. He could barely stand up to shake my hand. His shirt looked like it had been thrown in the wash with black socks, taken out while wet and then had wrinkles ironed into it. He had cut himself shaving and had a little piece of ragged cloth covering the bloody nick on his scrawny gullet.<br><br>We were interrupted by the approach of a fat man with strange lower teeth that actually poked out of his mouth and rested on his upper lip when his mouth was closed. Good evening. Miss McClure, I presume.&#x201d;<br><br> Professor Beech?&#x201d;<br><br> Ah, welcome to the adamantine island chained to the shifting bank of the Channel. I see you met our esteemed poet and guest of honour this evening? You&#x2019;ve been placed next to him for mutual dining pleasure.&#x201d;<br><br>While I nodded assent, the esteemed poet said, Ye es.&#x201d; I had never heard the word yes spoken in two syllables. Professor Beech scuttled (as fast as a man whose silhouette matched that of Alfred Hitchcock could scuttle) back to his end of the table, saying we would meet in his rooms&#x201d; tomorrow afternoon. That sounded kind of creepy to me.<br><br>As I sat down next to the esteemed poet I blathered, Sorry I&#x2019;m late. That stairwell is a challenge in these shoes.&#x201d;<br><br> Winding ancient stair; Set your entire mind upon the steep ascent,&#x201d; the esteemed poet said. By this point I was too embarrassed to ask his name. Everyone else seemed to know him.<br><br> <i>Hey</i> Yeats.&#x201d; Thank God I&#x2019;d recognized him. I love that guy.&#x201d;<br><br> As do I.&#x201d;<br><br> You know him too?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br> I knew him quite well.&#x201d;<br><br> Me too.&#x201d;<br><br> He gave me much help in dark times,&#x201d; said the esteemed poet.<br><br> Oh. You knew him as in knew the <i>man</i> not just the <i>poetry</i>.&#x201d;<br><br> If one ever knows another.&#x201d;<br><br> Wow!&#x201d; Wanting to keep the conversation going, I added my own brush with celebrity: I knew Marilyn Monroe.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and looked at me with true interest for the first time. Do tell.&#x201d;<br><br>I can spin a yarn for hours, so I told him the full version of when Roy and I delivered Nembutal to Marilyn Monroe while she was filming <i>Niagara</i> in the 1950s. I told how she answered the door in a slip and bra and had chipped nail polish.<br><br> I <i>say</i>,&#x201d; he added, do please press on.&#x201d;<br><br>Neither of us noticed that the room was quiet and when we finally looked up we met hundreds of eyes looking expectantly at us. The esteemed poet had been introduced to say grace but neither of us had heard.<br><br>He stood up really slowly, favouring one leg, and said by way of apology, The peril of discussing Yeats is that all else recedes.&#x201d;<br><br>He was great on his feet, never used a note and spoke in a definitive, yet warm voice for five or ten minutes. He said grace in Latin and in English and then said that tonight might be a perfect night to quote Yeats. He said you can be assured of a poet&#x2019;s genius when he always has a line or two that expresses exactly your sentiments at the present moment. He turned to me and said,<br><br> God be praised for woman<br>That gives up all her mind,<br>A man may find in no man<br>A friendship of her kind<br>That covers all he has brought<br>As with her flesh and bone . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He recited the whole poem and smiled at me as he sat down.<br><br>When dinner was over, I helped the doddering poet down the stairs, and while patting my hand, he again quoted Yeats: And what rough beast, its hour come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born.&#x201d;<br><br>To this day I don&#x2019;t know his name.<br><br>I shake my head now thinking of what the Barson called my plethora of errors&#x201d; upon arrival. The seat next to the guest of honour was saved for Professor Beech, who&#x2019;d been one of the esteemed poet&#x2019;s students, and I had blundered into it. My outfit combined with my Marilyn Monroe vignette was all so wildly inappropriate. Yet no one complained or embarrassed me. In truth, my behaviour in England barely improved over time.</p></p><h2>The Matzah That Papa Brought Home</h2><p>A cumulative rhyme in the style of &#34;The House That Jack Built&#34; describes the traditions connected to a family&#39;s celebration of the Passover seder. An ALA Notable Book. Reprint.</p><p>FRAN MANUSHKIN is the author of many books for children, including Baby, Come Out!, which has been translated into eight languages. She lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 2?A charming rephrasing of the traditional cumulative song "Had Gadya" that captures all the excitement, magic, inspiration, high jinks, and eventual exhaustion of a family celebrating a Passover Seder. Here, instead of a goat, the poem revolves around the matzah that Papa brings home, which inspires the feast that Mama makes, the seder they all share, etc. While the text is well done and great fun, the illustrations, rendered in oils, are stellar. Each masterful painting has a subtext. The family members are constantly moving or gesturing?while some are intent on praying or singing, a girl is shushing the dog, and a boy is intent on stealing the matzah. During the recapitulation of the plagues, the artist depicts real frogs and locusts jumping out of the wine glasses. The search for the hidden afikomen is positively frenetic, and the picture of the youngest child standing tall and proud (and still) to ask the Four Questions has great impact. Three pages at the end tell the story of Passover.

Thankfully, the humorous adventure of <i>Van Von Hunter</i> falls into the former group. A breezy introduction sets the tone of this Ameri-manga parody, and a refusal to take anything seriously permeates the story. The hero doesn't know what's going on. The sidekick is an amnesiac barmaid. Everyone has to be told by convenient bystanders what to do next in order to stop the nemesis, an evil prince, from finding a magical artifact that will let him take over the kingdom. As is typical of American-influenced comic art, the panels are busier and more crowded than Japanese manga. The art doesn't always live up to the story demands, as when a "packed tavern" is rather sparsely populated, or mystical artifacts under discussion are never shown. It can be hard to follow the plot, but the figures are well-designed and likable. The creators were the winners of Tokyopop's first Rising Stars of Manga competition, and their creation is an amusing quick read. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Mythlopedia)</h2><p><b>Love action, deception, romance, power struggles, and more!</b><br><br>Mythlopedia is a series where the superstars of Greek myth meet the modern age--complete with profiles, headshots, and family trees; fascinating sidebars; and irreverent surprises for readers (Ages 10-14).</p><p>Greek and Roman mythology is normally one of the easier sells for children, full of proto-superheroes, nightmarish monsters, and petty gods, but to help lure those unswayed by classicism&#x2019;s allure, the Mythlopedia series spices things up with sassy artwork, a pastel color scheme, and an OMG sensibility. What a Beast! is loaded with information on the inspired methods with which various nasty creatures could put an end to bothersome heroes. Aside from the heaps of information coming from all angles on just about every page, each book also contains a decent family tree, a rudimentary star chart, and lists of further reading. Will these books make a true mythology lover&#x2019;s skin crawl? Absolutely. But for kids unconvinced that anything so old and gray could have any bearing on their lives, these books provide a feisty if somewhat pandering guide to the many cultural references lingering from antiquity.

Tour.</p><p>So instead of a feisty, saucy shouter, an unassuming southern matron ascended to the throne as the honky-tonk era&#39;s Queen of Country Music. Kitty Wells was a thirty-three-year-old wife and mother when she rose to stardom. Into the new world of smoke-filled taverns, thudding jukeboxes and tears-in-your-beer misery stepped a woman of the old school who bent her traditional country style to suit the temper of the times....Publicly she sang of guilt and remorse, of illicit romance and sin, of betrayal and broken dreams. Privately she was the polite mother of three and a shy, soft-spoken, dutiful housewife. She was steeped in tradition, but became a star as an innovator.Attractively produced but flawed history of women in country music from the turn of the century to today, by anthropologist/social-worker Bufwack and Nashville Tennessean music-reporter Oermann. The narrative progresses chronologically by focusing on country's various genres, from old-time through social protest, cowboy songs, honky-tonk, gospel, rockabilly, the Nashville sound, 70's ``countrypolitan,'' and today's roots revival. Along the way, key performers are profiled, with brief discussions of their careers and most famous recordings. But while the authors' attempt to be inclusive is admirable, they sometimes stretch the definition of ``country'' music, citing Jo Stafford, Dinah Shore, and even Sophie Tucker as country performers. Biographies of artists are also occasionally spread over several different chapters, making for unnecessary repetition. And simple factual errors, such as asserting that the Appalachian dulcimer is the same as the instrument ``mentioned in the book of Daniel in the Bible,'' and, further, that it was ``brought to England as the psaltery during the Crusades,'' makes the reader wary of other ``facts'' offered here. At times, moreover, the authors' generally feminist argument stretches points, as in their discussion of the ballad ``Rising Sun Blues,'' which they assert is ``sung from the point of view of the rueful prostitute''; in fact, most versions are told from the point of view of the man, who pictures himself as the victim. There's a definite need for a serious and thorough history of country music, always a poor stepchild in musical scholarship, but this isn't it.

Her fifth novel <em>The Second Empress</em> will be published in 2012. Michelle&#x2019;s experiences at archaeological sites around the world inspired her to write historical fiction.</p> <p> I love how C.W. Gortner chooses maligned women in history and re-examines them in his novels within the context of their era. In The Queen&#x2019;s Vow, he has done it again, creating a mesmerizing and unforgettable portrait of Isabella of Castile. For all her fame, Isabella is often misunderstood. She&#x2019;s either revered as a near-saint or despised as a religious intolerant. Of course, most of us know she sent Christopher Columbus to America, but few of us have been told the amazing story of her youth, when Spain was a broken kingdom and she just a forgotten princess, whom no one expected to rule.</p> <p> It is the mid-1400s. In Europe, most countries are united under one ruler. But in Spain, ancient divisions between the kingdoms of Castile and Arag�n, and violent feuds between nobles, have created anarchy. Isabella is the daughter of an exiled widow, and she and her younger brother Alfonso live far from court in the countryside. Their royal father is dead; their mother haunted by the past; and their half brother, Castile&#x2019;s new king, barely reigns, dominated by his favorites and his conniving, beautiful queen.</p> <p> Then Isabella and Alfonso are sent to court, where they soon become pawns in a vicious struggle for power. Accused of treason, Isabella is held a prisoner, while her brother leads a rebellion. But when tragedy strikes, Isabella suddenly is named heir to the throne, though no woman before her has successfully ruled for long. As she embarks on a perilous path toward the throne, she indulges a forbidden desire for Prince Fernando of Arag�n&#x2014; a desire that pits her against her half brother the king and his ruthless nobles, all of whom seek her downfall. Can she marry the man she loves and still remain a sovereign queen? And how will she win over all her sworn enemies and restore peace in Spain after centuries of intrigue and discord?</p> <p> Gortner vividly recreates the turmoil of Isabella&#x2019;s youth and the striking contrasts of the country she knew, where the last Moors cling to their faded realm in the south and different cultures merge in uneasy alliance. Isabella&#x2019;s stormy rise to power and quest to become a worthy queen are stunningly described, but what makes Gortner&#x2019;s Isabella so unique is that while she is brave and daring, she is also conflicted&#x2014; a fallible woman exercising her power in a traditionally male-dominated world. In her, we can see ourselves. She is like us: passionate and hopeful, proud yet doubtful, compelled to fight for what she believes in. Though The Queen&#x2019;s Vow doesn&#x2019;t shy away from the terrible decisions she chooses to make, it reminds us that in the end, Isabella was human, a woman of conviction and strength in a time of upheaval, who forged her destiny despite every odd, to become Spain&#x2019;s most beloved queen.</p><b>C.

The news was crazy, incredible. The biggest merger ever, it was, according to the media, an "awesome megadeal" and "a fusion of guts and glory." It was "the deal of the century" and "a mega-marriage of earth and cyberspace." An Internet upstart, AOL was buying the world's most powerful media and entertainment company. "A company that isn't old enough to buy beer," marveled the <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> "has essentially swallowed an ancien r�gime media conglomerate that took most of a century to construct."</p> <p>Two years later, after the smoke had cleared, $200 billion of shareholder value had vanished into cyberspace. On the trail of possible fraud, the SEC and the Justice Department started investigating AOL Time Warner's accounting practices. Meanwhile, a civil war had broken out inside the company, complete with backstabbing and personal betrayals. Before long, almost every major player was out of the company, discredited, and humiliated. Jerry Levin, Time Warner's "resident genius," lost his job, lost his reputation, and, in the view of some people, simply "lost it." Steve Case, the visionary leader of AOL, was forced out of the company he had created. Gone too was the telegenic wonder-boy Bob Pittman, and his gang of fast-talking salesmen. As for Ted Turner, he resigned from his post as vice-chairman of AOL Time Warner in early 2003, bitter, wiser, and $8.5 billion poorer.</p> <p><em>Fools Rush In</em> is the definitive account of one of the greatest fiascos in the history of corporate America. In a narrative fraught with drama, Nina Munk reveals the overweening ambition and moral posturing that brought down the Deal of the Century. With painstaking reporting and the remarkable eye for detail she's known for, Munk lays out, step by step, the anatomy of a debacle. Irreverent, witty, and iconoclastic, she sees through it all brilliantly.</p> <p>"As in all great Greek tragedies, you knew the plot before it played out," one perceptive insider told Munk on the subject of the AOL Time Warner deal; "you knew who'd be sacrificed at the altar." Here's what we discover in <em>Fools Rush In</em>: In their single-minded quest for power, Steve Case and Jerry Levin were at each other's throats even before the deal was announced. Bob Pittman was regarded as a "windup CEO" by Case, and viewed as a hustler by just about everyone at Time Warner. Ted Turner underestimated Jerry Levin's ruthlessness badly. And Levin himself, convinced he was creating a great legacy comparable to that of Time Inc.'s founder, Henry Luce, refused to acknowledge the obvious: that, with a remarkable sense of timing, Steve Case had used grossly inflated Internet paper to buy Time Warner. </p></p><p>Nina Munk is a contributing editor at <em>Vanity Fair.</em> A former senior writer for <em>Fortune,</em> her work has appeared in the <em>New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker,</em> and <em>Forbes.</em> Born in Canada, she lives in New York City.Munk's entry to the growing list of books about the AOL Time Warner merger provides a thorough recap of the debacle, with the author coming to her own conclusion on the causes behind the merger's failure. After more than 100 pages of the obligatory background on AOL and its chairman, Steve Case, and Time Warner and chairman Jerry Levin, Munk begins to make her argument that Case and Levin, who ran their companies with few checks and balances, bear the greatest responsibility for orchestrating a deal that had little chance to succeed. She presses her case by hitting hard on the fact that few Time Warner executives knew about the pending deal until hours before it was announced, and that even fewer executives supported the proposal. That due diligence for the $165-billion merger only took three days and that many of the merged company's top managers sold large chunks of stock (including Case who sold shares worth $100 million) shortly after the deal closed is further proof to Munk that the combination was not well thought out and that many managers had doubts about its success from the very beginning. For readers looking for a quick review of events surrounding the AOL Time Warner merger, Munk's book fits the bill, but for those who are already well versed on the subject, Munk (a contributing editor at Vanity Fair) adds little new information. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The basis for the author s groundbreaking discoveries is their new version of the ancient Chinese oracle, published under the title, &#39;I Ching, the Oracle of the Cosmic Way.&#39; It shows humans as part of the harmonious order of the Cosmos. &#39;The Psyche Revealed Through The I Ching&#39; explains how the psyche, as the invisible side of our being, enables each of us to fulfill our unique Cosmic destiny.// Psychic malfunctions such as depression, phobias, and stress indicate that humans have separated from the harmonious order of the Cosmos through developing a mindset that places humans at the center of the universe. From this disharmonious perspective, humans have created a world order based on conflict and lack where there could be harmony, peace, and abundance. This book helps the individual who wants to free himself from the suffering caused by this mindset, to recognize the total goodness of his true nature, and to see with clarity the ideas that have brought him harm. Another cause of harm are unprocessed traumatic experiences. The book&#39;s Appendix shows the reader how to research these causes and deprogram them with Cosmic help, thereby to free himself enduringly from their harmful effects.// Perhaps most extraordinary, the I Ching, through the authors discoveries, is found to be an advanced psychology that reflects our deepest inner truth.// It is perhaps no accident that this book appears nearly simultaneously with the publication of C.G. Jung s Red Book. It was thanks to Dr. Jung that the I Ching was introduced to the English-speaking world in the early 1950 s. Were he still alive, he would have been happy to read this book that gives the answer to the riddle he hoped to resolve by undertaking the dangerous journey into his own psyche: It was his search for the origin of the demonic figures that were haunting the unconscious of his patients. As Carol Anthony and Hanna Moog discovered, these figures are the product of words that are not grounded in the harmonious order of the Cosmos, and therefore, they create conflict in our nature.// Once taken into the psyche (often at a very young age) these words take on a life of their own. Through the fears and self-doubts they create in us, they dominate our lives until such time as they are discovered and deprogrammed with Cosmic help. Deprogramming takes away the validity we have formerly given them, freeing us of their harmful effects.</p><p>This book brings us a new understanding of the psyche that allows us to go on our own inner journey of self-discovery. The authors, with the help of the I Ching, have illuminated this path in ways never described before.Described are functions of the psyche and its place in the personality. Understanding its unique capabilities enables us to free ourselves of conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and remove with Cosmic help, the programmed responses these conditions create in us. The book reveals the I Ching oracle to be a modern psychology that reflects our deepest inner truth.Carol K. Anthony; Hanna Moog ..// Carol Anthony began her study of the I Ching in 1971, during a mid-life crisis. She found that it immediately spoke to her on several levels of awareness, and taught her to meditate in an entirely new way. More than 7 years later her notes on her experiences with the I Ching were published in 1979 under the title, &#39;A Guide to the I Ching.&#39; It was followed by &#39;The Philosophy of the I Ching&#39; in 1981, &#39;The Other Way,&#39; in 1990, and &#39;Love, An Inner Connection,&#39; in 1994.// Hanna Moog, b. 1946, was a translator and editor of books on the I Ching into German, and editor-in-chief of a collection of essays by various authors under the title, &#39;Leben mit dem I Ging. Erfahrungen aus Kunst, Therapie, Beruf und Alltag.&#39;(&#39;Living with the I Ching. Experiences in the Arts, Therapy, and Professional and Everyday Life&#39;; Diederichs, 1996). She also contributed as a translator and commentator to the book &#39;I Ging, Das Orakel- und Weisheitsbuch Chinas (&#39;I Ching, The Oracle and Wisdom Book of China&#39;; Knaur, 1994). Hanna Moog, who has a master s degree in National Economics, and diplomas in French and English, came to the I Ching in 1982 during a personal crisis. Although she had no one to teach her the I Ching, she allowed it to speak to her feelings. &#39;I was deeply touched by its answers. I realized that no human being would have been able to characterize, as it did, my desperate situation so perfectly. At the same time, it gave me the deep certainty that there was something good in my life waiting to be discovered...something that meant growth, and a new kind of life; something that would truly fulfill me.&#39; Consulting the Richard Wilhelm translation of the I Ching daily, she felt that she often only got a glimpse of what it was saying, but she decided to keep her mind open so that a deeper understanding could take place through experience. Her dedication to the I Ching began to open more and more doors to being invited to speak and write about it. In 1985 she became a free lance editor for Eugen Diederichs Verlag, the company that had first published the Wilhelm translation, specializing in editing books and translations on the I Ching, Asian philosophy, and mythology.// In 1998, she joined forces with Carol Anthony and in 2000 they founded The I Ching Institute in Stow, Massachusetts, where both women conduct seminars and continue their researches into the I Ching.</p><h2>Hen Frigates: Wives of Merchant Captains Under Sail</h2><p>Through first-person accounts and maritime illustrations, a historian reconstructs the life of the courageous wives and daughters of sailing ship captains of the nineteenth century, who left everything behind to join their husbands at sea. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>"I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies and back again, and only once; besides being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon and Gibralter.... and I can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship. While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared." --Mrs. Croft in Jane Austen's <i>Persuasion</i><p> Much has been made of man's romance with the sea, and to read the literature--from Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> to Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i>--you'd never guess that women so much as got their feet wet in the surf, let alone went down to the sea in ships. But Jane Austen's fictional Mrs. Croft, the wife of an admiral, was by no means a rarity in her time as Joan Druett's fascinating exploration of women and the sea, <i>Hen Frigates</i>, makes clear. During the 19th century, women often accompanied their sea-captain husbands or fathers on oceangoing merchant ships, enduring the same hardships as the male sailors--sickness, poor weather, shipwreck, piracy--and a few of their own, as well, such as pregnancy and childbirth. Yet the history of women at sea has remained largely unwritten and unacknowledged. Then in 1984, Druett discovered the gravestone of a whaling captain's wife while bicycling on one of the Cook Islands in Polynesia. "A woman on a whaleship! It seemed incredible. Instantly fascinated, I thought I would look up a book to learn more about this young woman who had made such a strange and fatal decision to go to sea." What Druett discovered, however, was that there was no book. So she wrote one herself. In <i>Hen Frigates</i>, Druett has used the letters and journals of seafaring women to limn a portrait of 19th-century ship-going life, including matters such as sex, child-rearing and medical practices. From shipwreck and pirate attacks to the intricacies of navigation and the pleasures of visiting foreign lands, Druett's heroines shed new perspective on the 19th-century shipping news.</p>An engaging portrait of shipboard (and portside) life for women sailing with their husbands during the 19th century, from maritime historian and novelist Druett (Abigail, 1988). During the age of sail, American captains, and sometimes their first mates, were permitted to take their wives with them as they plied the coastal trade or struck out on trading voyages. The women were clearly a literate bunch, for they left behind a wealth of diaries and letters and journals, often dryly humorous and witty, that Druett gathered to fashion this evocation. Using extensive quotations from her sources, Druett describes what it was like to be the mistress on everything from schooners to downeasters to the tony packet ships; how the women contended with frights, privation, storms, monotony, and seasickness (or, as one woman termed it, ``paying homage to Neptune''); their experiences with pirates and cholera and mutiny. Many of the women made this their life, extending decades beyond the traditional honeymoon voyage (which was likely obligatory, as the family capital was the ship and there was no house to wait in), and they had to learn everything from medicine to navigation to raising a brood on a rocking boat to learning how to survive in a foreign port. Throughout, Druett keeps readers' attention by moving swiftly from episodes of intense excitementmenacing weather, dastardly crews, extreme heroicsto leisurely, droll observations, many of the best coming in the chapter on high-seas sex: One wife declared with spirit to her husband, ``I shall not be a fellatrix, Captain, oh my Captain, and if that be mutiny, make the most of it.'' Decidedly, these were women ``very aware of owning a certain aura of romance, of being widely traveled and worldly wise, something in which they took perceptible pride,'' and in Druett's hands their stories make for highly enjoyable reading.

A companion to the HBO documentary of the same name, <i>Sexual Intelligence</i> is a follow up title to Kim Cattrall's simpler, more technical <i>Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm</i>. Gorgeously sensual photos and a sprinkling of poetry cozy up to science, combining experts like Betty Dodson and Thomas Moore with Sappho and Georgia O'Keefe; this time around, the goal is exploration, rather than instant delivery. <br> <br> Specifically, all this lush intelligence directs itself towards education about why we want what we want. After poring over the five lovely chapters (Desire, Messaging, Arousal, Fantasy, and Release), you still might not have a definite answer, but the final pleasure far outweighs the impression of flightiness. Straightforward explanations of anatomy (a definite step up from school health class) intermingle with tales of ancient gods and goddesses that liven up facts, while the layer of glamour over all wraps the package in a big fluffy bow. Shots of classic paintings mix equally with shots of Kim, each providing eye candy that is tailored to please. <br> <br> Six "average folks," ostensibly representing a wide sample of sexual interests and ideas, provide quotes throughout the text; sometimes offering a complex thought, other times simply throwing in something along the lines of, "I drive a nice Porsche so I can get chicks." While their voices do help make the book more representative of the general population, it still feels like a book aimed mostly at straight women--which might make it a very handy title for straight men to keep in their living rooms.--<i>Jill Lightner</i> <p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td></tr> </tbody></table> </td></tr> </tbody></table> <b>Amazon.com Interview with Kim Cattral</b> <p></p> <p> <b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;Can you explain what you've got in mind by the phrase "sexual intelligence"? <br> <b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;A person who knows what they like! And has some idea why. Intelligence is traditionally defined -- Webster's for example would define intelligence as success in coping with situations and solving problems. Intelligence can also mean a collection of useful insight and information that enriches understanding. I used the word "intelligence" in the title of the book and the documentary because it reflects my desire to gather whatever insights, inspirations, and information that could nourish the part of us that is sexual and sensual, so that it might be strong and function well. <br><b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;What was the starting point for <i>Sexual Intelligence</i>? <br><b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;My previous book <i>Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm</i> was unabashedly a how to, complete with colored arrows and schematic diagrams by way of demonstration. People responded so positively the book -- they wrote me these amazing letters and I could see there remained an enormous amount to explore and learn -- for myself as well as everybody else. Orgasm is fabulous, but I realized I had started at the end of the story. Writing a book on how to satisfy sexual desire lead me to become more interested in what its roots and sources actually are. What inspires arousal in the first place? Where does it come from? What can it tell us? How does it keep us engaged with the world? <br><b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;Of the five chapters (Desire, Messaging, Arousal, Fantasy and Release), the one on desire is by far the longest. What makes this topic so much more important? </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b> Courage! [Samantha Jones] was courageous and totally without prejudice. </b></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;The idea of "desire" is really the central theme of the book. At one point I even thought of calling the book "desire" but it sounded too much like another celebrity fragrance, you know -- <i>Kim Cattrall: Desire</i>. But really, an investigation of desire was the key idea growing out of my previous book. It&#x2019;s funny, in a way this book is almost like a pre-quel to my previous book <i>Satisfaction</i> 'cause without desire, there ain't no "satisfaction." Something that came up right away in regard to desire or arousal, is that men and women tend to experience it differently and of course we wanted to include both points of view, so that made the chapter even longer! <br><b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;Your book draws on so many eras and cultures. Which one is the most inspirational for you? <br><b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;Looking at the stories and images that have informed and given expression to erotic impulses over the centuries was fascinating to me. They help give shape to the individual struggles and joys we experience through sex<table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b> The classical era of Greece and Rome are endlessly fascinating because those cultures so openly celebrated sex on both a literal and a metaphorical level. </b></td> </tr> </tbody></table> and also show what an enduring and central role sexuality plays in being human. The classical era of Greece and Rome are endlessly fascinating because those cultures so openly celebrated sex on both a literal and a metaphorical level. Their worship of the phallus mines a very rich vein of human drives and drama. The mythical figure of Aphrodite or Venus, the great Goddess of love, is an invention of pure cultural genius in how well it expresses the complexity, allure and power of sexuality. <br><b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;<i>Satisfaction: The Art of the Female Orgasm</i> came about in relation to your character on <i>Sex in the City</i>. How did your role as Samantha Jones influence this project? <br><b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;Courage! She was courageous and totally without prejudice. She was also self-accepting. Those are three valuable characteristics that I had the benefit of continually rubbing up against in the skin of Samantha Jones and I believe they came strongly into play on this project. <br><b>Amazon.com:</b>&nbsp;What was the most surprising thing you learned while working on the book? <br><b>Kim Cattrall:</b>&nbsp;Well, after living inside Samantha Jones for 6 years, you would think nothing would surprise me! But I learned an ENORMOUS amount. Even in areas that are very familiar, like looking at parts of the body or discussing the differences between men and women. I think "revelation" might be a better word -- there were so many instances of insight -- moments of -- "Aha, so that explains it!" Sexuality is such a vast subject and so complex. You realize you've been going on a trickle of knowledge when there's like gushing waterfall out there. <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <b> Examining the underpinnings of eroticism was very exciting. </b></td> </tr> </tbody></table> Some of the most revelatory material to me centered on new brain research and learning about what actually happens to us on a physiological and biochemical level during arousal, and even throughout a sexually charged relationship. Another area that offered so much new insight was learning how sexual fantasies actually function and how better to approach and understand them, even when they're quite odd -- which of course, being fantasies, they certainly can be. Also, examining the underpinnings of eroticism was very exciting. It's like we live with all of these images -- icons really -- like the dominatrix, the masked man, the naked half beast, or even from a classical standpoint, Venus on the half-shell. The images are achingly familiar, they've been with us for centuries, but what ever are they supposed to actually mean? Getting into all of that was extremely enriching. Images like those endure for reason. They speak to something elemental and universal. <p></p>Kim Cattrall was born in Liverpool, England, and raised in Canada.

How has the psychology of investing changed--and not changed--over the last five hundred years? <b>Edward Chancellor</b> examines the nature of speculation--from medieval Europe to the Tulip mania of the 1630s to today's Internet stock craze. A contributing writer to <b>The Financial Times</b> and <b>The Economist</b>, looks at both the psychological and economic forces that drive people to "bet" their money in markets; how markets are made, unmade, and manipulated; and who wins when speculation runs rampant. Drawing colorfully on the words of such speculators as <b>Sir Isaac Newton, Daniel Defoe, Ivan Boesky</b>, and <b>Hillary Rodham Clinton</b>, <b>Devil Take the Hindmost</b> is part history, part social science, and purely illuminating: an erudite and hugely entertaining book that is more timely today than ever before.</p><p>"The longest bull market in history" is a term that gets used a lot these days. Since 1990, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen some 8,000 points, from around 2,700 in January 1990 to nearly 11,000 today--a boom by anyone's standards, including Edward Chancellor's. In <i>Devil Take the Hindmost</i>, Chancellor takes an entertaining, albeit sobering, look at the history of speculative manias and the mass delusion that surrounds them.<p> Beginning with the "tulipomania" that gripped Holland in the 1630s, Chancellor chronicles the formations and irrational euphoria that can inflate markets, from shares of South Sea stock in England in the 1720s to real estate in Japan in the late 1980s. He characterizes the speculative spirit as one that </p><blockquote>loves freedom, detests cant, and abhors restrictions. From the tulip Colleges of the seventeenth century to the Internet investment clubs of the late twentieth century, speculation has established itself as the most demotic of economic activities. Although profoundly secular, speculation is not simply about greed. The essence of speculation remains a Utopian yearning for freedom and equality which counterbalances the drab rationalistic materialism of the modern economic system with its inevitable inequalities of wealth.</blockquote> But it's precisely such inevitability that always seems to win out, when "sharply rising prices followed by sudden panic without cause" bring speculative excess to an abrupt end.<p> Chancellor makes <i>Devil Take the Hindmost</i> especially relevant to today's U.S. investors by using his analysis of past speculative manias as a lens through which to view the current bull-market binge. No matter what his or her current investment outlook is--bull or bear--anyone with capital to invest would do well to spend a thoughtful weekend with this book. Highly recommended. <i>--Harry C. Edwards</i></p>Many modern economists hold that speculation is a benign economic activity, that it is always rational in motivation and rarely adverse in its effects. The struggles of the United States after the Crash of 1929 and of Japan in the 1990s suggest otherwise. Some commentators, the billionaire financier George Soros among them, believe that growing speculative forces threaten a global financial crisis. <p>Devil Take the Hindmost is an original and challenging history of stock-market speculation from the seventeenth century to the present day. Through vivid accounts of the speculative activities (wise and unwise) of investors ranging from Daniel Defoe and Benjamin Disraeli to Ivan Boesky and Hillary Rodham Clinton, Edward Chancellor shows that speculation is not driven solely by the desire to make money--by fear and greed--but springs from a wider range of human compulsions and aspirations. </p><p>Chancellor traces the origins of the speculative spirit back to ancient Rome and chronicles its revival in the modern world: from the Tulip Mania in Holland in the 1630s and the stock-jobbers in London's Exchange Alley at the end of the seventeenth century to the on-line "day-traders" of the information age. </p><p>Devil Take the Hindmost charts the development of speculation in the United States from the middle of the nineteenth century in chapters on Jay Gould and the Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties, and the junkbond mania of the 1980s. According to Chancellor, the American passion for speculation derives from the notion's fierce competitiveness and appetite for risk. This is a source both of the nation's strength--as shown by the vibrant U.S. economy in the 1990s--and of its potential weakness, as the lessons of the Great Depression of the 1930s suggest. </p><p>A chapter on the 'bubble economy" of the 1980s shows how the anarchic force of speculation undermined the Japanese economic system; and in an epilogue, Chancellor examines contemporary arguments for and against speculation in light of the recent crisis at the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund.</p></p><h2>Vampire Hunter D Volume 10: Dark Nocturne</h2><p>In the title story, &#34;Dark Nocturne,&#34; D is hired to unlock the secret of a siren&#39;s song that is drawing men in their twenties to their deaths in the hills outside Anise Village.

Already in his forties when he debuted with a full-length book, <b>The Apple That Astonished Paris,</b> Collins has become the first poet since Robert Frost to combine high critical acclaim with broad popular appeal. And, as if to crown this success, he was appointed Poet Laureate of the United States for 2001&#x2013;2002, and reappointed for 2002&#x2013;2003. <br><br>What accounts for this remarkable achievement is the poems themselves, quiet meditations grounded in everyday life that ascend effortlessly into eye-opening imaginative realms. These new poems, in which Collins continues his delicate negotiations between the clear and the mysterious, the comic and the elegiac, are sure to sustain and increase his audience of avid readers.</p><p>In <i>Nine Horses</i>, Billy Collins, U.S. poet laureate and author of the bestselling collection <i>Sailing Alone Around the Room</i>, attempts to find beauty in simplicity, but ends up achieving the simply banal. Some poems, such as "Rooms" and "Obituaries," in which readers are given freedom to draw their own conclusions, are memorable, but the language in <i>Nine Horses</i> has little music and thoughts are plainly stated. Animals (mostly mice and little birds) populate this sentimental journey, and they are nearly always personified, resulting in poems that sometimes read like the verse equivalent of a Thomas Kinkade print. Collins's use of the vernacular can be burdensome ("and you are certainly not the pine-scented air. / There is no way you are the pine-scented air"), but some readers may find comfort (a haven perhaps) in the author's warm, safe world. Billy Collins has become an immensely popular poet, and though <i>Nine Horses</i> may remain less than inspiring, its poems are certain not to offend. <i>--Michael Ferch</i>Praise for Billy Collins and <b>Sailing Alone Around the Room<br></b><br>&#x201c;He may be a sort of poet not seen since Robert Frost.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;It is difficult not to be charmed by Collins, and that in itself is a remarkable literary accomplishment.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>&#x201c;There are brainy, observant, spit-shined moments on almost every page....You finish feeling pleased that such a sensible and gifted man is America&#x2019;s Poet Laureate&#x2014;young writers have plenty to learn from his clarity and apparent ease.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>A Fool and His Monet (Serena Jones Mysteries)</h2><p>Serena Jones has a passion for recovering lost and stolen art--one that's surpassed only by her zeal to uncover the truth about the art thief who murdered her grandfather.

In the still-sun-lit northern night, they don costumes and begin to role play. But an uninvited guest soon brings their performance to a gruesome conclusion. His approach is careful; his aim is perfect. Three bullets, three corpses. The murderer then carefully photographs the grisly tableau. Meanwhile, the Ystad police station is experiencing a summer lull. Inspector Kurt Wallander is focusing on living healthier, but his peace of mind is shattered when a fellow officer is murdered. The police slowly realize how little they know about what is going on in their seemingly serene town. An unknown killer is on the loose, but their only lead is a photograph of three dead young people in costume. Forced to dig more deeply than he'd like into the personal life of one of his colleagues, Wallander's investigation uncovers something he could never have imagined. <i>One Step Behind</i> is the fifth book to appear in English in what the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i> calls the "exquisite" Kurt Wallander series.</p><p>Sixth in the Kurt Wallander series. <br>On Midsummer's Eve, three role-playing teens dressed in eighteenth-century garb are shot in a secluded Swedish meadow.

But with his only clue a picture of a woman no one in Sweden seems to know, he can't begin to imagine how. Reeling from his own father's death and facing his own deteriorating health, Wallander tracks the lethal progress of the killer.

Before that he'd been apprenticed as a joiner, receiving his signed indentures and freedom on the attainment of his twenty-first birthday; at which point he'd given up working <i>with</i> woods to work <i>in</i> them. And from then until he was sixty-five and pensionable, like many a good Scot before him, he'd cannily managed his affairs and silted away a percentage of his middling but not entirely insubstantial wages.Biding his time, he'd kept his contempt for the Laird well hidden, until the evening of his sixty-fifty birthday (the 2nd May, 1984), when, leaving the stables and crossing the paddock for the last time, he'd walked up to the great granite house at the heart of its many acres of woods and entered his master's rooms. There Hamishhad checked the contents of his wages envelope, laid down in a neat bundle his shotgun, notebook, dog whistle and certain lesser appointments of his profession, and resigned. It was his right, for he was sixty-five and there'd never been a written contract."But ... what'll I do?" The old laird had been flabbergasted. "And more's to the point, what'll you do, Hamish?" Hamish was head gillie; the others in the Laird's employ, for all their years of service, weren't nearly so experienced and much less trustworthy."Ah shid imagine," Hamish had grunted, "that ye'll do as ye've done for the last forty-four years--<i>verra</i> little! As for maself: there's a wee property come available in Lawers overlooking the water. Ah shall buy it and spen' ma time fishing and reading--what time's left to me." And he did just that.For the next ten years he would get up each day, breakfast, open his windows over Loch Tay and do his deep-breathing exercises. At nine o'clock he'd get his bicycle from the lean-to and, weather permitting, peddle a fairly leisurely seven miles down to Killin at the eastern end of the loch, there to visit an old sickbed friend who'd been dying for fifteen years and never got any closer to the actual box. Hamish's mongrel dog, Barney, would trot alongside; which in the main was how the two of them got their exercise.But on this Sunday morning in mid-June of 1994, a few weeks after Hamish had clocked up seventy-five years, things were to work out just a little different.The morning was bright if somewhat chillyfor the time of year, and Hamish found the bike ride invigorating and even exhilarating--to a point. That point being reached when, in a moment, his emotions switched from exhilaration to astonishment. He saw it as he cycled round a gentle right-hand bend in the road: that which could not possibly be there to see. And his gnarled hands at once gripped the handlebars that much tighter, causing his front wheel to wobble. Barney, trotting alongside, yelped and narrowly avoided a trapped paw, by which time Hamish had brought his machine to a halt.He sat there astride his bike, one foot on the ground, jaws agape and eyes staring their utter disbelief. The object of his amazement, what he could see of it, was a house, or even a mansion by its size; indeed, more a castle, with its turrets and battlements. It stood midway between twin spurs coming down from the lordly Ben Lawers, its base hidden by the ridge of a scree saddle and its back to a steep incline where granite outcrops came thrusting through the thin turf. A castle, yes, and not unlike many another of much the same size, period and general construction; in itself, hardly a matter for astonishment. Castles abound in Scotland, and to a native dour as Hamish Grieve one castle seemed much like any other; unless you were talking about the really grand jobs, like the one on the Mount of Edinburgh, for instance.No, the building itself (in any other circumstance) would hardly take Hamish by surprise. But the fact that he'd found it here, now, would and did--for as recently as yesterday morning it had <i>not</i> been here! Neither then nor any othermorning for the last ten years, and for all the long years of time gone before that!Hamish shook his head, rubbed at his eyes, frankly couldn't accept the evidence that his senses were offering him. But the longer he stared, the more undeniably solid the castle looked to him. Could it be, he wondered, that the thing really had been there all of this time, and he simply hadn't looked that way before, hadn't noticed it? But that was to ignore the facts, indeed to ignore his own especially lucid memory. Last summer, on these very slopes, he'd seen French and English botanists examining Ben Lawers' rare alpine plants. Six months ago there'd been skiers up there, coming over the crest of that very scree-filled depression. Hamish had always hated these periodic incursions of tourists and foreign riffraff, but now he thanked the Lord for these memories of them. Without such memories his sanity itself must be suspect.Or perhaps it wasn't so much his sanity but his sight. He'd heard of people damaging their eyes like that, but never thought it could happen to him. "Barney," he said, still gazing at the castle rising there over the scree less than three-quarters of a mile away, "have ah been hitting it too hard? Is a couple or three wee drams of a nicht too much, d'ye think? Could it be that an accumulation o' malt's addled ma brains, eh?" But Barney only wagged his stump of a tail and whined, as he always did when he was worried."Well, ma laddie," said Hamish, more to himself now than to the dog, "it seems we'll just have tae look into this, you an' me."There was a track climbing from the road toa spot maybe halfway between Hamish and the object of his curiosity, climbing in fact along the sharp, narrow ridge of the eastern spur. Hamish left the road, cycled a little way up the track until the going got too heavy, then leaned his bicycle against a boulder and continued on foot. Barney stayed right to heel, uncomplaining, perhaps wondering at this rare break in the tradition of so many years.Finally, climbing above the scree ridge, Hamish paused for a breather and studied more closely the mysterious castle. And despite the fact that there was a great deal wrong with that enigmatic structure, at least Hamish was no longer in doubt of his eyesight.The place most definitely <i>was</i> there; its squat foundations going down into scree, its frontage like half a hexagon, forming a flat face with flanking walls angling sharply back; and the frowning granite walls themselves, going up maybe fifty feet to the turrets and crenellated battlements. And all grandly set against Ben Lawers, rising majestically to its cloud-piercing four-thousand-foot crest; all very impressive, solid and powerful seeming. And very, very wrong.For there was no road to the place, not even a track, and no windows in it that Hamish could see. And perhaps most peculiar of all, no doors ...Up here, with a breeze tugging at his light coat and the sun warming his neck, space seemed to open up for Hamish Grieve and time to stand still. Long moments passed while his breathing settled down and his heartbeat slowed. Barney sat at his feet, stump of a tailwagging a very little, small whines sounding now and then from deep in his chest.Finally Hamish shivered. His neck might be warm but the rest of him felt unaccountably cold. Or perhaps not unaccountably. It wasn't every day that something like this happened.Before he could begin shivering again he started forward, skirted the castle, began to climb the ridge of the spur towards its rear. Down there, sheep clambered in the rocks at the castle's base and chewed on the coarse grasses. Hamish paused and stared at them. If sheep weren't afraid of the place, whatever it was and however it came to be here, he didn't see why he should be.Scrambling down from the spur onto the level, overgrown scree, he moved right up to the base of the inexplicable edifice. Hexagonal, yes; he followed the planes of its walls to the rear. And it was here, close up, that he first noticed the shimmer.The walls shimmered--very faintly, almost unnoticeably--as though viewed through thin blue wood smoke, or the heat reflected from a tarmac road. It wasn't hot enough for that, to be sure, and there were no fires that Hamish could see, but still the castle shimmered. Like ... a mirage?The base of each section of wall was perhaps thirty-five feet long; pacing to the rear, Hamish gazed along the entire length of the back wall where the stony hillside rose up and away from it. There were sheep back there, who lifted their heads to look at him curiously, before returning to their munching. But one of them stood half-in, half-out of the shimmer.Hamish's jaw fell open. The sheep, a fat ewe, was browsing on the coarse grass at the foot of the wall, but its rear quarters disappeared <i>into</i> the granite! Which could only mean--"It really <i>is</i> a mirage!" Hamish gasped. "Unsolid, unreal!"He approached the castle's wall more closely yet, with Barney right behind him, whining ever more loudly and persistently. The shimmer was faint but quite definitely there; the wall, for all that it was opaque and seemed thoroughly dense, must be entirely matterless, a trick of the light and freakish Nature; that sheep there, not ten paces away, was surely all the evidence one required.Hamish put out a slightly trembling hand until his four fingertips touched the shimmer. He felt something like the very mildest of mild electric shocks--but in the next moment the shimmer disappeared and the wall was suddenly real. Hamish knew it as surely as he knew that he stood here. What had been or might have been a mirage had suddenly stiffened into reality, becoming solid. In a single split second--occurring simultaneously with a shrill, terrified, and agonized bleat--the tingling in his fingertips had been replaced ... by pain!He snatched back his hand, clutched it, gazed bug-eyed at his fingertips. They looked like he'd rested them for a moment on the surface of a rapidly revolving drum of sandpaper. Blood welled up from four flat discs of flesh at the tips of his fingers."What?" said Hamish to himself, scarcely able to accept what he couldn't hope to understand. "What?"Along the now entirely solid wall something had happened. Something lay crumpled there, still twitching. Clutching his hand, Hamish stumbled to see what it was, went to confirm an awful suspicion. Barney went with him, sniffed at the freshly dead ewe and backed away from it stiff-legged. For the animal was only half a sheep now, the front half, lying there where its body had been sliced through like a worm by a straight-edged razor. Collapsing, its severed trunk had left a swath of blood like fresh red paint on the hard granite wall.Hamish Grieve held his breath, took all of this in, felt his heart beginning to hammer in his chest. The "mirage" wasn't a mirage, and the castle wasn't a castle, and nothing here was even nearly right.He backed away from the blank, looming wall and began to climb the side of the stony spur to its narrow ridge. But because he went backwards his progress was slow, and not for a single moment did he shift his gaze from the castle that wasn't a castle.Barney was right there with him, yipping and snapping a little to hasten him on. Then Hamish's heel came down on a loose stone and it threw him; flat on his back he tobogganed to the bottom again, numbing himself where hard projections banged his spine. Barney, very nearly frantic, came scrambling after, tugging at his master's sleeve to get him mobile.Hamish sat up. In front of him--but <i>directly</i> in front of him--the wall's surface was shimmering again. And its base now came right up against the foot of the spur!Breathing raggedly and feeling he was goingto faint--for the very first time in a long and, until now, entirely mundane life <i>knowing</i> he was going to faint, but not daring to--Hamish began to climb again. He climbed like a youth, soaring up the side of the spur, and without pausing glanced fearfully back over his shoulder. The castle was expanding, its wall flowing forward to engulf boulders where they held back the sliding scree not six feet behind and below him.At the top, burned out, Hamish heaved himself up over the rim and lay facedown, sucking at the air and gulping harshly in a throat dry as a granary. Sheep, likewise fleeing, stampeded past him and away, up and down the spur. A breeze blew on him and gradually cooled the heat of his exertions.Down below, the castle was as he'd first seen it; solid seeming and ordinary enough at first glance, but now, to Hamish, totally alien.Barney was nowhere to be seen ... .Copyright � 1990 by Brian Lumley</p><h2>Tree of Birds</h2><p>After Harry nurses Sally, a green-tufted tropical bird, back to health, he is reluctant to let her fly south with her friends.</p><p>Susan Meddaugh was born and raised in Montclair, New Jersey. She graduated from Wheaton College, where she studied French literature and fine arts. After working briefly with an advertising agency in New York, she moved to Boston and worked at a publishing company for ten years, first as a designer, then art editor, and finally as art director. While there, she did the illustrations for GOOD STONES (Houghton Mifflin) by Anne Epstein, and then decided to strike out on her own as a freelance illustrator and creator of children&#39;s books. Since that time, Susan has written and illustrated many popular books for children, including MARTHA SPEAKS, which was chosen as a NEW YORK TIMES Best Illustrated Book for 1992. In 1998 she was awarded the New England Book Award, given by the New England Booksellers Association to recognize a body of work. Her work also was acknowledged with a New York Times Best Illustrated Award. She lives in Sherborn, Massachusetts."Oh, Mom," says Harry, arriving home with a wounded bird in his arms. "Oh my!" responds his mother, in the sort of understatement found--in words and pictures--throughout this delightful book. It is clear that Harry's broken-winged bird, whom he names Sally, is no ordinary sparrow or pigeon. She is, according to the boy's bird book, a Green Tufted Tropical, a species that cannot tolerate cold weather. This concerns Harry, as winter is on its way. But something else arrives first: an enormous flock of Green Tufted Tropicals, anxious to find Sally. Harry tries everything, but he can't get the persistent creatures to leave their perch in a tree outside his window. When the temperature drops and the first snowfall is forecast, the chattering birds turn blue, but Harry comes to their rescue in an unexpected way. Meddaugh strikes just the right balance between the absurd and the credible in this fanciful tale; children will reach for it again and again.

Reissue.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: SpanishIn these short, polemical, engaged essays, the noted Mexican critic and poet locks horns with writers, past and present. He calls Dostoyevski "our great contemporary," a novelist who forces us to see our divided selves, our nihilism. Whitman, the sincere dreamer of utopian democracy, is contrasted with Poe, Melville and Dickinson, whose writings are "more like attempts to escape from the American nightmare." Paz is disappointed in Sartre, a thinker who "always preferred shadows to realities." While defending Solzhenitsyn's Christian humanism, he feels the novelist's ignorance of modern history amounts to arrogance"a very Russian trait." Paz investigates the act of seeing in Bunuel's cinema of disillusion, William Carlos Williams's search for American roots, Michaux's mescaline visions and Breton's magic surrealism.

While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person&#39;s consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or &#34;sleeve&#34;) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Ex-U.N. envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Dispatched one hundred eighty light-years from home, re-sleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco, now with a rusted, dilapidated Golden Gate Bridge), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats &#34;existence&#34; as something that can be bought and sold.

The path that God has chosen for us to discover who we really are is the path of holiness. The most exciting thing is that this path is not for otherworldy saints, rather it is a path of earthy, gutsy holiness. It's a path that is not about basing your life on this world or of shunning your desires. Instead, it is about bringing your hopes, your dreams, your brokenness, your desires, your humanness under the Lordship of Christ.

Theos Bernard&#x2019;s colorful, enigmatic, and sometimes contradictory life captures an intersection of East and West that changed our world.</b><br>&nbsp;<br>After years of forcibly stopping foreigners at the borders, the leaders of Tibet opened the doors to their kingdom in 1937 for Theos Bernard. He was the third American to set foot in Tibet and the first American ever initiated into Tantric practices by the highest lama in Tibet. When Bernard left that sacred land, he was sent home with fifty mule loads of priceless, essential Buddhist scriptures from government and monastery vaults. Bernard brought these writings to America, where he achieved celebrity as a spiritual master. Appearing four times on the cover of the largest-circulation magazine of the day, befriending some of the most famous figures of his era, including Charles Lindbergh, Lowell Thomas, Ganna Walska, and W.

Like Alexandra David-Neel who traveled through India and Tibet before him, Theos journeyed far, both geographically and psychologically to find the teachings of yoga, tantra and Buddhism and more importantly teachers who could give him a taste of the amrit: the fruit, which destroys death. Theos&#x2019;s story will take the reader to India and Tibet and introduce them to some of the greatest mystics who have ever lived including Glen Bernard (his father), Pierre Bernard (his uncle) Blance DeVries (his aunt), Ora and Inayat Khan (his aunt &amp; uncle), Pir Vilayat (cousin) the famous spy, Nor Khan (cousin), the Russian artist theosophist, Nicholas Roerich, aviator, Charles Lindbergh, Paramahansayogananda, Geshe Ngawang Wangyal and The 13th Dalai Lama, to name a few, and illuminate their influence to the yoga which is practiced in the west today.&#x201d; &#x2013;Sharon Gannon, founder Jivamukti Yoga method<br><br>&#x201c;I thought that I had read my last yoga-mystical-magical-wonderous-cliffhanging-historic-pageturning-lifechanging-adventure years ago.

These pages are enriched by family photos, dining passages from stories such as <i>A Moveable Feast, The Old Man and the Sea</i>, and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, his short stories, personal correspondence, and even a contribution from his last wife Mary. Collecting recipes from former Hemingway haunts, period cookbooks, and other sources, this book is an authentic re-creation of the meals that enriched Hemingway&#x2019;s literature<br></p><p>On the 100th anniversary of Ernest Hemingway's birth, Craig Boreth gives the reader a tour of the author's taste buds in <i>The Hemingway Cookbook</i>. With chapters titled "The Early Years," "Italy," "France," "Spain," "Key West and Cuba," "East Africa," and "Idaho," as well as the Hemingway Wine Cellar and the Hemingway Bar, the reader is assured of finding taste treats ranging from fried trout to fried gudgeon, from pork and beans and spaghetti to eland piccata. And everywhere in between are countless photos of Hemingway with and without beard, as well as with and without clothes. <p> Boreth's contribution to Hemingwayiana is in providing the connective tissue among all the various stations of the author's life, collecting all possible references to food and drink, and then ferreting out suitable recipes to evoke a similar pleasure. For example, in the 1920s Hemingway writes about a lunch with John dos Passos ("whom I consider a very forceful writer, and an exceedingly pleasant fellow besides"). The meal included Rollmops (a herring dish), Sole Meuni�re, Civet de Li�vre � la Cocotte (jugged hare), and Marmelade des Pommes. Boreth provides the recipes. The reader is left to wonder what the Montrachet 1919, the Hospice de Beaune 1919, and the bottle of Chambertin might have been like. </p><p> <i>The Hemingway Cookbook</i> reads like an anthology of postcards sent back from the author's life. The collected recipes are eccentric, as any collection connected to any individual could not help but be. It's like being handed a metal box stuffed with 3-by-5 recipe cards, all of them written in Hemingway's hand and gathered from one end of his life to the other. A curiosity, really. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><b>Craig Boreth</b> eats, drinks, and writes in and around Davis Square in Somerville, Massachusetts.<br></p><h2>Rogue Warrior: Blood Lies</h2><p><p>When the daughter of a retired Navy SEAL is kidnapped and held for ransom in Mexico, Rogue Warrior Richard Marcinko and his band of Red Cell International warriors head south of the border to rescue her.

Walk down the wrong street, flash some cash, act a little tipsy&#x2014;before you know it, you&#x2019;ve got a crowd lining up behind you, fighting over who has dibs.<br>Getting kidnapped is harder. First of all, it pays to be choosey. You don&#x2019;t want to be kidnapped by just anyone. Or let me say, you don&#x2019;t want to be kidnapped by the <i>wrong</i> anyone. The crime has to be seen as a business transaction, not one of passion. Passion will quickly get you killed, not just in Juarez but anywhere.<br>It also has to be the right kind of business transaction. You don&#x2019;t want it to be part of a merger and acquisition. The latter is pretty common in Juarez, where drug cartels and their various factions are constantly jostling for position. If your kidnappers grab you as part of a hostile takeover, your chances of emerging with significant limbs intact is small.<br>You want to be kidnapped by someone who doesn&#x2019;t see you as competition, who expects a good ransom, and who knows that damaged goods are bad for business. He should be fairly adept at it, too&#x2014;the last thing you want is a nervous finger on the 1911 Model knockoff when it&#x2019;s pushed against your ribs. (Most kidnappers in general are male, and this is especially true in Mexico. I&#x2019;m not sure why they gravitate toward inexpensive versions of the venerable Colt automatic; maybe they get a bulk discount. Or maybe they missed out on our ATF royally fucked-up scam&#x2014;excuse me, <i>sting</i> operation&#x2014;&#x201c;designed&#x201d; to trace U.S. illegal gun sales throughout the Southwest, Midwest, and dead West. It was your typical cocked-up brain-dead government operation, helped along by some greedy cock breaths on the U.S. side of the border.)<br>If you want to be grabbed by higher-end thugs, you have to position yourself just right. Attractive and available alone won&#x2019;t cut it. Your cover story has to fall close to the profile of people they like to snatch. You also have to present yourself as easy, but not such a patsy that lesser villains try to pick you off the street.<br>Becoming functional bait isn&#x2019;t just a difficult business, it&#x2019;s an art form.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>My interest in kidnapping was sincere and honorable. I wanted to be grabbed as part of a plan to free a legitimate kidnap victim, the twenty-two-year-old, tactfully blond and delicately curvaceous daughter of a fellow SEAL.<br>There were ulterior motives as well, the most important of which had to do with Hezbollah1 and a reported terror camp in the border area. But that part of the story is best saved for a moment when things are a little calmer. Because at the moment this book begins, I&#x2019;m east of Juarez being chased by a pair of pickup trucks filled with gun-toting banditos. My foot is to the floor and the big Cadillac is fishtailing across a sandy Mexican road parallel to the border.<br>The car responded by pulling to the left, the torque steer nearly jerking her out of my hands. Careful not to overcorrect, I muscled the vehicle onto the pavement, holding the nose steady as the speedometer stretched toward triple digits.<br>I&#x2019;m not ordinarily a Cadillac guy; if I were going to choose a car from Government Motors at all it would probably be more in the Chevy line. But this Caddy had a lot going for it&#x2014;most especially the ceramic plate inserts throughout the chassis and body designed to withstand anything short of a 120 mm armor-piercing shell. The glass&#x2014;front, back, and sides&#x2014;had been replaced with thick bulletproof material, all of which added a shitpot of extra weight to this lead sled. In exchange, the armor could ward off slugs from a .300 Win mag.<br>Unfortunately, the bastards behind me opened fire with a pair of fifties&#x2014;as in 50 mm machine guns. The bullets, heavier and designed to act like frickin&#x2019; can openers, peppered the back of the car. A dozen shattered the window, embedding themselves in the ceramic plates in the driver&#x2019;s seat behind me.<br>I ducked as low as I could, trying to hide behind what was left of the seat as bullets splattered through the interior of the car, smashing the burled walnut interior accents and adding random vents to the automatic climate control. The front windshield spiderwebbed with bullet holes, and the radio, which had been playing an old Willie Nelson tune about cowboys, gave up the ghost.<br>That was pretty much the last straw. I veered right, then reached for the flasher button.<br>The button was preset to send a radio signal to my trail team; roughly translated, the signal meant &#x201c;Get your fucking butts over here and rescue my ass.&#x201d; Only not as polite.<br>In theory, I didn&#x2019;t need the signal: we had a small UAV overhead watching, sending signals to a temporary command post and the trail team. But theory and reality had already separated: in <i>theory</i> the gang I was enticing as a kidnap victim didn&#x2019;t fire at its victims. In reality, the bastards behind me were about to fry me alive.<br>I swung left and right, onto the shoulders, then back to the highway. As I came up over a rise, I spotted a tractor-trailer headed in my direction and moving at a good clip. I waited until he had pulled almost even, then swerved my car, sliding off the road behind him but managing to regain the pavement in the opposite direction of my pursuers.2<br>Somewhere between the bullets and the hard turn, two of my four tires blew out. That didn&#x2019;t slow me down too much, since they were run-flats (or more accurately &#x201c;run while shot to shit&#x201d; flats), but I strongly suspect there was a connection between the blowouts and the stench of burning rubber that began filling the cabin.<br>At least I didn&#x2019;t have to worry about ventilation. I kept my foot firmly on the floor, heading in the direction of the pickup truck with the first half of my trail team, Shotgun and Mongoose, aka Paul &#x201c;Shotgun&#x201d; Fox and Thomas &#x201c;Mongoose&#x201d; Yamya. Somewhere to the east, behind me now, was another vehicle with two more of my shooters, Trace Dahlgren and Tommy &#x201c;Tex&#x201d; Reeves. Both halves were undoubtedly heading at high speed to my rescue. I thought <i>eventually</i> they were going to converge and help get me the hell out of this mess.3<br>Unfortunately, it didn&#x2019;t look like I was going to reach <i>eventually</i>. As I approached the back of the tractor-trailer, the tailgate rolled up, revealing another machine gun.<br>It began peppering the pavement in front of my car with bullets. I pulled the wheel hard right, taking the car off-road. The Caddy&#x2019;s front end had been carefully reinforced, but even a Bradley Fighting Vehicle would have buckled under the strain. What was left of the windshield disintegrated; steam started shooting from the hood area. I lost the rest of the tires and struggled to keep the car moving, wrestling with it as it wove and bucked in a drunken, smoky swirl.<br>Flames flicked from the floor. I had two options:<br>a) get the hell out of the car or<br>b) start a second career as a burn-center test dummy.<br>I chose a).<br>The car, against all common sense and probably the laws of physics and motion, was still moving at a very good pace; jumping would have been even more suicidal than staying. We careened back toward the road, then swirled sideways and slid down a washboard gully flanking the macadam. Sparks flew as the rims and chassis hit the asphalt, rebounded across the highway, then spun onto the soft desert sand and came to a stop.<br>I wish I could have said the same for my head, which was turning revolutions so fast it felt like it was trying to unscrew itself. By the time I managed to get my seat belt undone and the door open, I was engulfed in a thick, inky fog of smoke and fire. I coughed like a three-pack-a-day smoker, falling to my knees on the ground. I started crawling toward daylight.<br>The tractor-trailer stopped catty-corner across the road about seventy-five yards ahead. The machine-gun fire had stopped. For a moment I thought the smoke might give me enough cover so I could hide in the desert until my people arrived; surely they&#x2019;d be along any second now.<br>Then something flew out of the back of the trailer. It looked like a fastball thrown by Nolan Ryan during his heyday, but it was even more explosive&#x2014;a 40 mm grenade.<br>It sailed well off the mark, a good seventy yards or more over my head: right into one of the kidnappers&#x2019; pickup trucks. The driver tried veering at the last moment, but all he succeeded in doing was tipping the vehicle as the grenade hit. It toppled over impressively.<br>I scrambled to my feet and began running to the south, trying to get behind as much of the drifting cloud of haze and smoke as I could. A second grenade flashed overhead, exploding a little closer than the other.<br>Murphy,4 or his close cousin, Dumb Luck, smiled on me at that moment, sending a tourist bus down the highway. The bus driver, driving like the attentive, cautious man most are, was doing close to ninety and didn&#x2019;t realize the truck wasn&#x2019;t going to get out of the way until he was too close to stop. He hit the horn, slammed on the brakes, and then power-steered off the road, trying to swerve around it. He nearly made it&nbsp;... until the rear quarter panel of the bus came back and clipped the front fender of the truck.<br>The bus tumbled and the trailer slammed sideways just as the grenadier fired another round. I jumped up and ran, heading toward a wide ditch a hundred or so yards off the road. Sliding in, I took as long a breath as I dared, then started down it to the east, trying to put as much distance between me and the artillery as possible.<br>Unfortunately, the plan to have myself kidnapped had left me without a personal weapon; even businesslike kidnappers tend to think the worst when they spot a gun. There was a small radio device in my belt transmitting my location, and I also had a special phone imbedded in the heel of my boot.5 But aside from my fists and my...</p><h2>Weeds</h2><p>Identities and illustrates the common weeds of northern U.S. and Canada</p><p></p><h2>The Last Stalinist: The Life of Santiago Carrillo</h2><p><p>The life of the complex, ruthless adversary of General Franco, whose life spanned much of Spain&#x2019;s turbulence in the 20th century.</p><p>From 1939 to 1975, the Spanish Communist Party, effectively lead for two decades by Santiago Carrillo, was the most determined opponent of General Franco&#x2019;s Nationalist regime.

Drawing on the numerous, continuously revised accounts Carillo created of his life, and contrasting them with those produced by his friends and enemies, Spain&#x2019;s greatest modern historian Paul Preston unravels the legend of a devastating and controversial figure at the heart of 20th century Spanish politics.</p></p><p><p>Paul Preston CBE is Pr�ncipe de Asturias Professor of Contemporary Spanish History and Director of the Ca�ada Blanch Centre of Contemporary Spanish Studies at LSE.

To recapture the essence of the temple&#39;s significance, both in the life of Israel and in the life and theology of the early Christians, readers are fortunate indeed to have as a tour guide that eminent scholar of Judaism and the New Testament, Alfred Edersheim. Readers who want to experience the grandeur of Herod&#39;s temple - the temple that Jesus &#34;cleansed&#34; - or the anguish of a temple trodden by Roman soldiers will appreciate Edersheim&#39;s knowledge of and passion for the temple of Scripture. Readers will also welcome this newly typeset, highly readable edition with illustrations and marginal references from Scripture, Philo, Josephus, and the Mishnah.<p>Alfred Edersheim (1825-89) was a Vienna-born biblical scholar who converted from Judaism to Christianity. A veteran minister and missionary to the Jews of Romania, Edersheim left an enduring and priceless legacy to followers of Christ. Among his most widely read works are "The Life and Times of Jesus the Messiah, The Temple: Its Ministry and Services, " and "Bible History Old Testament."</p></p><h2>Yoga, Meditation, and Mysticism: Contemplative Universals and Meditative Landmarks</h2><p>Contemplative experience is central to Hindu yoga traditions, Buddhist meditation practices, and Catholic mystical theology, and, despite doctrinal differences, it expresses itself in suggestively similar meditative landmarks in each of these three meditative systems. <br> <br> In <i>Yoga, Meditation and Mysticism</i>, Kenneth Rose shifts the dominant focus of contemporary religious studies away from tradition-specific studies of individual religious traditions, communities, and practices to examine the 'contemplative universals' that arise globally in meditative experience. Through a comparative exploration of the itineraries detailed in the contemplative manuals of Theravada Buddhism, Pata�jalian Yoga, and Catholic mystical theology, Rose identifies in each tradition a moment of sharply focused awareness that marks the threshold between immersion in mundane consciousness and contemplative insight. As concentration deepens, the meditator steps through this threshold onto a globally shared contemplative itinerary, which leads through a series of virtually identical stages to mental stillness and insight. Rose argues that these contemplative universals, familiar to experienced contemplatives in multiple traditions, point to a common spiritual, mental, and biological heritage. <br> <br> Pioneering the exploration of contemplative practice and experience with a comparative perspective that ranges over multiple religious traditions, religious studies, philosophy, neuroscience, and the cognitive science of religion, this book is a landmark contribution to the fields of contemplative practice and religious studies.</p><p>Kenneth Rose explores the unity of meditative experience by illustrating similarities between contemplative itineraries in Hindu classical yoga, Buddhist <i>bhavana</i>, and Catholic mystical theology.<b>Kenneth Rose</b> is Senior Research Fellow,Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California, USA, and Professor of Philosophy and Religion, Christopher Newport University, Virginia, USA.

It allows just about any at-home inventor, artist, or engineer to design, create, and "print" their own parts, artwork, or whatever else can be imagined &#x2014; all at very reasonable costs. <i>Idiot's Guides: 3D Printing</i> explores this new revolution by explaining all of the basics of materials, parts, software, modeling, design, and finishing. The book then takes it to the next level by teaching readers how to take their new skills and print some simple, fun projects. Helpful advice on setting up a home-built 3D printer, buying a manufactured printer, selecting raw materials, and finding plans and projects online, are also covered.</p><p><b>Cameron Coward</b> is a mechanical designer, a serial hobbyist, and an all-around geek.

Beginning in the 1500s, Europeans began assembling individual collections of natural and man-made objects and filling their &#34;cabinets of curiosities&#34; with specimens that gave them a sense of wonder about the world and satisfied their fascination with oddities. Wonder chambers, Wunderkammen, like those of Levin Vincent evolved over the centuries into modern museums. When I walk around the halls of a museum, I have experiences like those of learning about the world I had in childhood. It is an inspirational feeling. Beyond the great art museums of the world, some of my favorites include medical museums and museums of natural history. The Museo la Specola in Florence, Italy, with its rooms full of eighteenth-century wax anatomical figures, is breathtaking. The surreal atmosphere of the mysterious old rooms is exhilarating to me. There is a medical museum in Thailand containing some of the strangest displays I have ever seen. (Things I find to be &#34;strange&#34; I also often find to be elevating.) I frequently go to the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, where a death trap for prehistoric mammals has become a treasure trove of fossils. I could spend days walking around New York&#39;s natural history museum with its Hall of Biodiversity, where on a single wall you can see the range of life forms on earth from diatoms to monkeys. I stand there in humble awe of the variety of strange creatures that coexist on this planet. Museums are places any person can go to quietly contemplate and be filled with a sense of wonder. When I am in these places, I feel like making paintings.</p><p></p><h2>Eight Stories From Rest of the Robots</h2><p>"The First Law of Robotics" A Robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

Filled with unforgettable characters- woman spy, a daredevil pilot, and heroic soldiers on both sides of the battle--and updated to include a chapter comparing today's special forces to those from the Vietnam era, The Green Berets is an action-packed, unforgettable chronicle of a secret war and the extraordinary men who fought it.<br></p><p>Robert Lowell Moore Jr., AKA Robin Moore, who was born on Halloween Night (October 31) 1925 in Boston, Massachusetts, always wanted to be a writer. True to his Halloween birthdate, Robin's choice of topics have frequently leaned toward the supernatural and macabre. <p>Robin was raised in Concord, Massachusetts and attended Middlesex School and Belmont Hill School. After graduating from Belmont Hill, he joined the armed forces and flew a tour of combat missions over Germany during the closing days of World War II. He graduated from Harvard College in 1949 and went to New York to produce television shows. In 1952 he returned to Boston to work for the Sheraton Hotel Company co-founded by his father, Robert Lowell Moore senior. But, what Robin really wanted to do was write. </p><p>His first novel, Pitchman was about the burgeoning TV business. He continued to work for Sheraton and as a result of trying to establish Sheraton hotels in the Caribbean in the late 50s he ran across Fidel Castro which led to his chronicling the Cuban communist dictator's guerrilla campaign in a non-fiction book The Devil To Pay. A third novel about Robin's family business, Hotel Tomayne, brought about the end of his career in hotel management and was the start of his full-time writing career. </p><p>In 1963 his Harvard classmate, Robert Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy's brother, made it possible for Robin to join the US Army Special Forces as a civilian. Robin went through almost a year of training and then went to Vietnam with the Special Forces and wrote his definitive novel of the Vietnam War, The Green Berets which was published in May of 1965. </p><p>The French Connection followed this first success when Robin joined the New York police department in one of their most spectacular drug busts. Robin continued to write and his next big hit was The Happy Hooker with Xaviera Hollander, the story of the most controversial madam in New York City. </p><p>Robin then went on to write many more novels about international intrigue and adventure. He often traveled internationally to gather background material for his books. </p><p>Robin returned to Southeast Asia to write The Country Team about American diplomacy and Green Beret operations in Asia. The Khaki Mafia was next, chronicling the adventures of a beautiful, blond Australian girl's adventures as an entertainer and talent booker to US Army posts throughout Vietnam. </p><p>A stint as a treasure hunter in the Caribbean led to The Treasure Hunter. In the 70s Robin spent a year in Iran and the middle east researching his next novel, Dubai, an epic of gold smuggling, oil exploration, and political subversion in the Arab world. Two novels of gambling followed. The first was the story of a great con game, The Big Paddle and the other was the heartbreaking tale of a compulsive gambler, Compulsion. Robin returned to his hotel background in The Fifth Estate. </p><p>One of his more recent novels, The White Tribe, was the result of three years spent in Africa observing American and European mercenaries fighting communist terrorism. After Africa Robin traveled to Russia where he did extensive research leading to The Moscow Connection, the story of the sale of Russian nuclear weapons to rouge nations. His latest book, The Sparrowhook Curse, a paranormal tale of love and family revenge, was the result of many years summering at his parents island home on Cuttyhunk Island. </p><p>Robin continues to write and is currently working with Raymond Flynn, former US Ambassador to the Vatican and former Mayor of Boston, on a novel about Vatican intrigue, The Accidental Pope.</p></p><h2>Despicable Me 2: Meet the Minions: Level 2 (Passport to Reading)</h2><p>Children&#39;s Book.The Minions have one job, and one job only--they work for Gru!

My fingers can barely hold the pen. But I promised myself I'd start this letter before returning to England, and this really is my last chance.<br><br>Last thoughts, then, on leaving the European mainland? On coming home?<br><br>I'm scouring the horizon and looking for omens. Calm sea, clear blue sky. Surely that has to count for something.<br><br>People come up here to kill themselves, apparently. In fact there's a boy further down the path, standing dangerously close to the edge, who looks as though he may be planning to do exactly that. He's been standing there for as long as I've been on this bench and he's only wearing a T-shirt and jeans. Must be freezing.<br><br>Well, at least I haven't got to that point yet; although there have been some bad moments, these last few weeks. Moments when it seemed like I'd lost my bearings completely, that it was all spinning out of control. You must have known that feeling, once. In fact I know you did. Anyway, it's over now. Onwards and upwards.<br><br>Beneath me I can see Etretat, the wide curve of its beach, the pinnacled rooftops of the chateau where I stayed last night. I never did manage to explore the town. Funny how, when you have the freedom to do anything you want, you end up doing so little. Infinite choice seems to translate into no choice at all. I could have headed out for sole dieppoise and ended up being plied with free Calvados by a flirty waiter; instead I stayed inside and watched some old Gene Hackman movie dubbed into French.<br><br>Four out of ten, for that. See me afterwards. Could do better. Is this any way to begin a new life?<br><br>Am I really beginning a new life, in any case? Perhaps I'm just resuming an old one, after a long and finally pointless interruption.<br><br>On board the ferry, Pride of Portsmouth<br><br>In the restaurant<br><br>Tuesday, 7th December, 1999<br><br>Late afternoon<br><br>I wonder how they manage to make a profit from this line, at this time of year? Apart from me and the man behind the counter--what should I call him, is he the steward or purser or something?--this place is deserted. It's dark outside now and there is rain flecking the windows. Perhaps it's just spray. Makes me want to shiver looking at it, even though it's warm inside, almost overheated.<br><br>I'm writing this letter in the little A5 notebook I bought in Venice. It has a silky blue hardback cover with a marbled pattern, and lovely thick, roughly cut pages. When I've finished--if I ever finish--I suppose I could always cut the pages out and put them in an envelope. But there wouldn't be much point, would there? Anyway, it hasn't got off to a flying start. Rather self-indulgent so far, I'd say. You'd think I'd know how to write to you, after the thousands and thousands of words I've written in the last few years. But somehow, every new letter I write to you feels like the first one.<br><br>I've got a feeling this is going to be the longest of all.<br><br>When I sat down on that bench high on the chalk cliffs above Etretat, I hadn't even decided whether it was you I was going to write to, or Stefano. But I chose you. Aren't you proud of me? You see, I'm determined that I'm not going to go down that road. I promised myself that I wouldn't contact him, and a promise to yourself is the most binding of all. It's difficult, because there hasn't been a day for four months when we haven't spoken, or emailed, or at least texted. That kind of habit is hard to break. But I know it will get better. This is the cold turkey period. Looking at my mobile sitting on the table next to the coffee, I feel like an ex-smoker having a packet of fags dangled in front of her nose. It would be so easy to text him. He taught me how to send text messages, after all. But that would be a crazy thing to do. He'd hate me for it, anyway. And I'm scared of him starting to hate me--really scared. That scares me more than anything. Silly, isn't it? What difference does it make, if I'm not going to see him again?<br><br>I'll make a list. Making a list is always a good displacement activity.<br><br>Lessons I've learned from the Stefano disaster:<br><br>1. -Married men rarely leave their wives and daughters for single women in their late thirties.<br><br>2. -You can still be having an affair with someone, even if you're not having sex.<br><br>3.<br><br>I can't think of a number three. Even so, that's not bad going. Both those lessons are important. They'll stand me in good stead, the next time something like this happens. Or rather, they'll help me to make sure (I hope) that there won't be a next time.<br><br>Well, that looks good, on paper--especially this expensive, thick, creamy, Venetian paper. But I remember a line that Philip always used to quote to me. Some crusty old pillar of the British establishment who said, in his dotage: "Yes--I've learned from my mistakes, and I'm sure I could repeat them perfectly." Ha, ha. That will probably be me.<br><br>Fourth coffee of the day<br><br>National Film Theatre Cafe<br><br>London, South Bank<br><br>Wednesday, 8th December, 1999<br><br>Afternoon<br><br>Yes, I'm back, sister darling, after an interruption of twenty hours or so, and the first question that occurs to me, after a morning spent more or less aimlessly wandering the streets, is this: who are all these people, and what do they do?<br><br>It's not that I remember London very well. I don't think I've been here for about six years. But I do (or thought I did) remember where some of my favorite shops were. There was a clothes shop in one of the back streets between Covent Garden and Long Acre, where you could get nice scarves, and about three doors along, there used to be some people who did hand-painted ceramics. I was hoping to get an ashtray for Dad, a sort of peace-offering. (Wishful thinking, for sure: it would take more than that . . . ) Anyway, the point is, neither of these places seems to be there any more. Both have been turned into coffee shops, and both of them were absolutely packed. And also, of course, coming from Italy I'm used to seeing people talking on their mobiles all day, but for the last few years I've been saying to everyone over there, in a tone of great authority, "Oh, you know, they're never going to catch on in Britain--not to the same extent." Why do I always do that? Bang on about stuff I know nothing about, as if I was a world expert? Jesus, everybody here has got one now. Clamped to their ears, walking up and down the Charing Cross Road, jabbering to themselves like loons. Some of them have even got these earpieces which mean you don't realize they're on the phone at all, and you really do think they must be care-in-the-community cases. (Because there are plenty of those around as well.) But the question is--as I said--who are all these people and what do they do? I know I shouldn't generalize from the closure of a couple of shops (anyway, perhaps I got the wrong street), but my first impression is that there are vast numbers of people who don't work in this city any more, in the sense of making things or selling things. All that seems to be considered rather old-fashioned. Instead, people meet, and they talk. And when they're not meeting or talking in person, they're usually talking on their phones, and what they're usually talking about is an arrangement to meet. But what I want to know is, when they actually meet, what do they talk about? It seems that's another thing I've been getting wrong in Italy. I kept going round telling everybody how reserved the English are. But we're not, apparently--we've become a nation of talkers. We've become intensely sociable. And yet I still don't have a clue what's being said. There's this great conversation going on all over the country, apparently, and I feel I'm the one person who doesn't know enough to join in. What's it about? Last night's TV? The ban on British beef? How to beat the Millennium bug?<br><br>And another thing, while I remember: that bloody great wheel that's appeared on the side of the Thames, next to County Hall. What's that for, exactly?<br><br>Anyway, that's enough social commentary for now, I think. The other things I wanted to tell you are, first of all, that I've decided to face the music, bite the bullet and so on, and go back to Birmingham tonight (because the hotel prices here are phenomenal, and I simply can't afford to stay here for another day); and also that I may have been back in England for less than twenty-four hours, but already I'm faced with a blast from the past. It comes in the form of a flyer I picked up at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. There's going to be a reading there on Monday, the title of which is "Goodbye to All That." Six "figures from public life" (it says here) are going to tell us "what they most regret leaving behind or what they are happiest to see the back of, at the end of the second Christian Millennium." And look who's number four on the list: no, not Benjamin (although he was the one we all thought would be a famous writer), but Doug Anderton--who we are told is a "journalist and political commentator," if you please.<br><br>Another omen, maybe? A sign I'm not making a bold foray into the future after all, but taking the first involuntary steps on a journey backwards? I mean, for God's sake, I haven't seen Doug in about fifteen years. The last time was at my wedding. At which, I seem to remember, he pressed me drunkenly up against a wall and told me that I was marrying the wrong man. (He was right, of course, but not in the sense that he meant it.) How weird would it be now, to sit in an audience and listen to him pontificating about pre-millennial angst and social change? I suppose it would just be a version of what we all had to put up with more than twenty years ago, sitting around the editorial table of the school magazine. Only now we're all developing grey hai...</p><h2>My Lover Is a Woman</h2><p>My lover is a woman <br>&amp; when i hold her--<br>feel her warmth--<br>i feel good--feel safe<br>--Pat Parker<br>My Lover is a Woman is a stunning anthology that places lesbian poets at the forefront of the contemporary literary scene.

The probing fierceness of Adrienne Rich's "Love Poem," the subtle longing in Joy Harjo's "Late Summer Leaving," the intense sexual rhythm and tension in Olga Broumas's "She Loves," and the entrancing lament of June Jordan's "A Poem for Haruko 10/29" are just a few examples of the rich talent displayed in this volume.<br>These poets have written daring confessions of love, sorrow, anger, and joy. Each poem is an elaborate confirmation of the resilience of the human spirit, and the ability to transform experience--including the struggle against the societal taboo of same-sex love--into brilliant poetry. My Lover is a Woman is a searingly honest account of the vast variety of lesbian love, written with the integrity and intelligence of women from many backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>These romantic, sensual, poignant, and humorous poems courageously describe lesbian experience in a way that pays tribute to the diverse and complex nature of women&#39;s sexuality."[An] outstanding collection . . .
